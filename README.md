# The Doors of Stone (Fan Fiction)

> *A fan-written continuation of Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicle, using the Snowflake Method*

## About This Project

This is a creative exercise: using rigorous outlining techniques to craft a satisfying conclusion to Kvothe's story. Every unresolved thread from *The Name of the Wind* and *The Wise Man's Fear* has been catalogued and addressed.

**⚠️ This is fan fiction, not official content.**

## The Snowflake Method

This project follows [Randy Ingermanson's Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/), starting with a single sentence and expanding systematically into a complete novel outline.

## Acknowledgments

All credit for the original Kingkiller Chronicle goes to **Patrick Rothfuss**. This is a work of love and speculation by fans who couldn't wait any longer.
