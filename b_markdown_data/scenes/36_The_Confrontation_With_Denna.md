## What happens in this scene
- Kvothe finds Denna by the Omethi River
- He tells her everything: the Chandrian, his family's murder, the Cthaeh's words
- He reveals that Master Ash is Cinder—the same being who killed his parents
- He begs her to leave her patron, to trust him
- Denna's response devastates him:
  - She knew her patron was dangerous. She stayed anyway.
  - He gave her power—written magic, skills, independence through strength
  - She won't let Kvothe's obsession take that from her
- She accuses him of wanting to possess her, just like her patron
- "You want to save me. But you never asked if I wanted saving."
- They say unforgivable things
- Denna sings a single note and something *shifts*—her magic is real
- She says: "We're both weapons. The only difference is, I know who's wielding me."
- They part as enemies
- Kvothe has lost her—not to Cinder's machinations, but to his own failure to see her as autonomous
