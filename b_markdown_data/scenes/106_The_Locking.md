- He understands: he can't fix what he's done, but he can stop himself from making it worse
- In the ancient place, he does something unprecedented
- He speaks his own true name—not to call it, but to LOCK it
- It's like sealing a door from the inside
- He takes everything he is—power, identity, self—and locks it away

- Bast follows, becomes his student and keeper
- The thrice-locked chest is built, containing: his true name (written), Caesura, the key to the Doors
