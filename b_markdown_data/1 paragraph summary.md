Kvothe returns to the University armed with the Adem's knowledge of the Chandrian's true names and signs, but his research into the Amyr leads him to a terrifying discovery: the organization still exists, hidden within the University itself, and they consider him the threat that must be contained.
When Kvothe finally uncovers the identity of Denna's patron as Cinder—the very Chandrian who killed his parents—he must choose between warning her and maintaining his advantage, a choice that leads to a devastating confrontation where Denna, refusing to believe him, reveals she has been writing magic into her songs and sides with her patron against Kvothe.
Following the trail to the Lackless estates, Kvothe discovers he is the heir to the family secrets and possesses the key to the Doors of Stone; opening them to pursue the Chandrian, he inadvertently releases something that was meant to stay imprisoned—and in the chaos, kills King Roderic Calanthis (manipulated by the Chandrian's schemes), triggering a war and earning the name Kingkiller.
In a final desperate act, Kvothe attempts to speak his own true name to seal away his power and the knowledge of how to open the doors, becoming "Kote"—a broken man who retreats to the Waystone Inn to wait for death, having lost Denna, caused a war, and discovered that his entire quest was orchestrated by the Cthaeh to cause maximum catastrophe.
As he finishes his story for Chronicler, the scrael attack the inn in force, and Kvothe must decide whether to reclaim himself and face the consequences of what he's done—or let the world burn.
