# Chapter Five: The Greater Good

---

There are patterns in the world that only madmen see. And sometimes, when the madmen are right, we call them prophets.

I have never claimed to be a prophet. But on that night, in the deep Archives, I saw a pattern that changed everything. A pattern that revealed the true shape of the conspiracy I had stumbled into.

And like any good madman, I mistook revelation for understanding.

---

It began with a conversation I should not have heard.

I had been in the Archives for three days straight, sleeping in the Stacks when exhaustion forced me down, eating bread and cheese from a satchel I kept hidden behind a row of Aturan legal texts. The scriv who managed the night desk had long since stopped questioning my presence—I was Kvothe, after all, and Kvothe's obsessions were legendary.

I was deep in the restricted sections on the fourth level down, where the oldest texts were kept behind locked gates and the air smelled of dust and ancient secrets. The restrictions meant nothing to me anymore—I had learned the Adem trick of moving without sound, and the locks that protected the rarer collections were no match for a sympathy binding and a steady hand.

I had found something. Not information about the Chandrian directly, but something adjacent—a reference in an old Yllish text to a group called the *Tehlu-reth*, the "Servants of the Lord." The text was fragmentary, damaged by water and time, but what remained suggested that the Tehlu-reth had existed long before the Tehlan Church, that they had served an older purpose, that they had been responsible for—

The voices reached me first.

Two men, speaking in low tones, approaching my position from the main corridor. I pressed myself into the shadow of a tall shelf, controlling my breathing the way the Adem had taught me, letting myself become part of the darkness.

"—foolish to let him continue," one voice said. Older, authoritative. "The Lackless heir has already found too much."

"Lorren believes he can be contained." This voice I recognized: Master Hemme, the sympathy instructor who had despised me from my first day at the University. "Monitored and redirected."

"Lorren's confidence is misplaced. The boy has already made contact with the Cthaeh. Every action he takes from this point forward is poisoned."

My heart stopped. They knew about the Cthaeh. They *knew*.

"What would you have us do? Kill him? That would draw more attention than his research."

"Not kill. Not yet." The older voice was cold, considering. "But he cannot be allowed to reach the door. If he learns what lies behind it—if he learns what the Lackless heir is *for*—"

They passed my hiding place. Through the gaps between books, I caught a glimpse of Hemme's familiar scowl and the profile of a man I didn't recognize—older, grey-haired, wearing the dark robes of no order I could identify.

"The Chandrian are moving," the stranger continued. "Cinder has a new project—the Lackless girl's music. If the heir reaches the door before we can redirect him, he'll find Cinder's work. He'll understand. And if he understands—"

"He'll try to stop it."

"Yes. And he might succeed. The boy is dangerous, Hemme. More dangerous than you know. The Cthaeh chose him for a reason."

Their voices faded as they moved deeper into the Archives. I stayed frozen in the shadows, my mind racing.

*The Lackless heir*. They were talking about me. They knew about my mother, about my heritage, about my connection to whatever lay behind the four-plate door.

*The Chandrian are moving. Cinder has a new project.*

Denna's song. The song about Lanre, about the tragic hero who became Haliax. The song woven through with yllish magic that made people believe.

And beneath it all, the terrible implication: the Amyr existed. They were here, in the University, watching me. And they were enemies of the Chandrian, but that didn't make them my allies.

*For the greater good.* That was the Amyr's motto. But whose greater good? And at what cost?

---

I didn't sleep that night.

Instead, I followed the pattern. I pulled every thread I could reach, tracing connections I had missed before.

The man with Hemme. I had never seen him in the University, never heard his voice among the Masters. But his robes—I had seen those robes before, in an old woodcut from a pre-Aturan text. The Amyr. The original Amyr, the ones who had existed before the Church created its pale imitation.

If the original Amyr still existed—if they had been operating in secret for centuries—then the conspiracy was larger than I had imagined. It wasn't just a few missing books, a few removed references. It was a shadow organization that had been shaping history for thousands of years.

And I was at the center of it.

*The Lackless heir.* The words echoed in my mind. My mother had been Netalia Lackless, eldest daughter of one of the oldest noble houses in Vintas. She had given up her inheritance to run away with an Edema Ruh trouper, but the blood remained. I was her son. I was the heir.

But heir to what?

The four-plate door. Whatever lay behind it, the Amyr were protecting it—or protecting the world from it. And somehow, my blood was the key.

I thought about the Lackless rhyme. The one Lady Lackless hated, the one children sang in schoolyards:

*Seven things has Lady Lackless*
*Keeps them underneath her black dress*
*One a ring that's not for wearing*
*One a sharp word, not for swearing*
*Right beside her husband's candle*
*There's a door without a handle*
*In a box, no lid or locks*
*Lackless keeps her husband's rocks*

The rhyme had always seemed like nonsense, a mocking ditty about a noble family. But now, in the light of what I had learned, the words took on new meaning.

*A ring that's not for wearing.* A ring of bone? A ring of stone? Something that circled but was never meant for a finger.

*A sharp word, not for swearing.* A name. A true name, perhaps—the kind of word that could cut.

*A door without a handle.* The four-plate door. The door that had no visible means of opening.

*In a box, no lid or locks.* The Lackless box. The one I had seen in the Maer's possession, smooth and seamless, containing something no one could reach.

I was the Lackless heir. And if the Amyr were right, then I was the key to opening something that had been sealed for thousands of years.

The question was: what?

---

I found Master Lorren the next morning.

He was in his office, surrounded by the paperwork of his position—acquisition requests, catalog updates, the endless bureaucracy of maintaining the largest collection of knowledge in the world. When I entered, he looked up with his usual placid expression, but something flickered behind his eyes. Recognition? Wariness?

"Kvothe," he said. "You look as though you haven't slept."

"I haven't." I closed the door behind me. "I need to ask you something, Master Lorren. And I need you to tell me the truth."

"I always tell the truth."

"You tell *a* truth. You tell the truth that serves your purposes." I sat down across from him, meeting his eyes directly. "Last night, I overheard a conversation in the Archives. A conversation about me. About the Lackless heir. About the four-plate door."

Lorren's expression didn't change, but the silence that followed was heavy with implications.

"You were in the restricted sections," he said finally. "Without permission."

"Yes. And I heard things I wasn't supposed to hear. Things about the Amyr."

The word hung in the air between us. For a long moment, Lorren said nothing. Then, slowly, he leaned back in his chair.

"You are remarkably difficult to manage, Kvothe."

"So I've been told."

"What do you think you know?"

I considered lying, considered playing ignorant to see what he would reveal. But there was no point. If the Amyr were as old and powerful as I believed, they would see through any deception.

"I know the Amyr still exist," I said. "I know they've been operating in secret for centuries, maybe longer. I know they've systematically removed information about the Chandrian from the Archives—not to help the Chandrian, but to prevent anyone from learning what they're capable of. And I know that somehow, I'm important to whatever they're protecting. Because of who my mother was. Because of what I might be able to open."

Lorren was quiet for a long time. The silence stretched between us like a wire pulled taut.

"You spoke with the Cthaeh," he said finally.

It wasn't a question. I nodded.

"Then you are already lost." His voice was heavy with something that might have been grief. "The Cthaeh speaks only truths, but those truths are poison. Every word it said to you was designed to bring about the worst possible outcome. For you, for the people you love, for the world."

"I know."

"Do you?" He leaned forward, and for the first time, I saw real emotion in his face—not anger, not fear, but a profound weariness. "The Amyr have been fighting this war for longer than you can imagine. We have sacrificed everything—our identities, our histories, our very names—to keep the world safe from what lies behind the doors. And now you come, a boy who has spoken with perfect malice, and you expect us to *trust* you?"

"I don't expect anything. I just want answers."

"Answers." He laughed, and the sound was hollow. "You want to know what your mother was? What you are? What the Lackless family has been protecting for a thousand years?"

"Yes."

He stood and walked to the window, staring out at the University below. "The Lackless family is old, Kvothe. Older than the Church, older than the Aturan Empire, older than most of the nations that exist today. They were guardians before they were nobles. They were given a duty in the days after the Creation War, a duty that has passed from generation to generation for millennia."

"What duty?"

"To keep the door closed." He turned to face me. "To protect the key. To ensure that what lies behind the Doors of Stone never escapes."

"The Doors of Stone," I repeated. "The prison of Iax."

"You know more than I thought." He sighed. "Yes. The Doors were sealed at the end of the Creation War, to contain the power of the greatest Shaper who ever lived. Iax didn't die—he couldn't die, not in any way that mattered. His body was destroyed, but his power remained, and that power was locked away behind doors of stone that could only be opened by one thing."

"Lackless blood."

"Lackless blood. And the key that the family has guarded since the sealing." His eyes met mine. "You are the heir, Kvothe. You have the blood. And if you find the key—if you open the door—"

"I would release what destroyed the world."

"No." His voice was sharp. "You would release what *will* destroy the world. The barrier is weakening. The scrael you've heard about, the dark things that stir in the shadows—those are the first signs. The Chandrian know this. They want the door opened. They believe that releasing Iax's power will break their curse."

"And the Amyr?"

"We believe that if the door opens, everything ends. Not just kingdoms, not just empires—*everything*. The mortal world and the Fae, burned away by power that was never meant to be unleashed." He stepped closer to me. "That is why we have worked so hard to erase knowledge of the Chandrian, of the Amyr, of the Doors themselves. Because the greatest protection is ignorance. If no one knows the truth, no one can be manipulated into opening the door."

"But I know," I said. "I know everything now. The Cthaeh told me. You can't make me forget."

"No." Lorren's voice was heavy with resignation. "We cannot. And that is why you are the most dangerous person in the world."

---

I left his office with my mind full of fire.

Everything made sense now. The missing books, the altered histories, the conspiracy of silence that surrounded the Chandrian and the Amyr—all of it was meant to protect a secret so terrible that even speaking of it was dangerous.

And I was the key. The heir to a bloodline that could open the prison of the greatest monster in history.

The Amyr wanted to contain me, control me, redirect my search away from the truth. The Chandrian wanted to use me, to manipulate me into opening the door that would free them from their curse—even if it destroyed everything else.

And the Cthaeh? The Cthaeh wanted both. The Cthaeh wanted the worst possible outcome, and somehow, I was the instrument that would bring it about.

I stood in the courtyard of the University as the afternoon light faded, feeling the weight of everything I had learned pressing down on me. For the first time in my life, I understood what it meant to be trapped—not by chains or walls, but by knowledge. By the simple, terrible fact that I knew too much to walk away and not enough to know what to do.

But I was not a man who accepted helplessness. I had survived Tarbean. I had survived the Fae. I had survived the Cthaeh's poison and the Amyr's surveillance and the slow death of everything I loved.

I would find a way. I would learn the truth—all of it, not just the pieces that others wanted me to know. And when I finally understood the shape of the game being played, I would make my own move.

The Amyr believed I was a weapon. The Chandrian believed I was a tool.

I would show them what it meant to underestimate Kvothe the Arcane, Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Kingkiller.

*"That's when it really began," Kote said softly. "That's when I stopped being a student and became a player. I thought I was clever enough to outmaneuver them all—the Amyr, the Chandrian, the Cthaeh's poison. I thought that knowing the truth would set me free."*

*He stared into the fire, his eyes distant.*

*"I was wrong. The truth didn't set me free. It set me on fire. And by the time I realized what was happening, I had already burned everything I touched."*

*Chronicler's pen had stopped moving. "What did you do next?"*

*"What I always did." Kote smiled, and there was no joy in it. "I made a plan. I gathered information. I played the game the only way I knew how—by pushing forward, by refusing to stop, by believing that my cleverness would be enough."*

*He stood and walked to the window, staring out at the darkness.*

*"I was the Lackless heir. I was the key to the Doors of Stone. And I was exactly what the Cthaeh had been waiting for: a brilliant, arrogant, wounded young man who would tear the world apart trying to save it."*

*The silence that followed was absolute—the silence of a story turning toward its inevitable end.*

*"But that," Kote said, "is a tale for tomorrow. And we have had enough of tales for one night."*

*He turned from the window, and in the firelight, his hair seemed almost red again—the color of flame, the color of blood, the color of a world on the edge of burning.*
