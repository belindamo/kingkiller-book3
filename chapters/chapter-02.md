# Chapter Two: Homecoming

---

There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.

I had faced all three by the time I returned to the University. What I did not expect to fear was a cup of metheglin and the concern of a friend.

---

The University looked the same. That was the problem.

I walked through the gates as the afternoon light fell golden through the turning leaves, and everything was exactly as I remembered—the grey stone of the Masters' Hall rising against the sky, the distant clatter of the Fishery, the students moving between buildings with their arms full of books and their heads full of dreams. Even the smell was the same: autumn air mixed with the faint sulfur of artificing and the green promise of the Medica's herb gardens.

But I was not the same, and the disconnect was dizzying.

The boy who had left these gates four months ago had been clever, hungry, and reckless. He had known a thousand songs and a hundred clever tricks. He had been young.

The man who returned had learned the names of the Chandrian from the Adem, had spoken with the Cthaeh, had walked through the Fae and emerged with knowledge that burned like ice in the center of his chest. I had held Felurian's naked form in my arms and survived. I had killed men with my hands and a sword named Saicere—*Caesura*—because the Adem blade deserved a name that matched its function.

I was not the same.

The students passing me seemed impossibly young, their faces unlined by the knowledge that the world held things that would crush them without noticing. I wanted to shake them, to tell them that their exams and their rivalries and their young loves were children's games played on a board whose true players moved pieces the size of kingdoms.

Instead, I kept walking, my cloak pulled close against the wind, my sword a subtle weight at my hip.

---

Simmon found me before I had even decided where to go.

"Kvothe!" His voice rang across the courtyard, cutting through the ordinary sounds of academic life with the pure joy of someone who has just seen a friend return from what might have been death. "You impossible bastard, you're actually back!"

He was running—literally running—toward me with his noble's clothes slightly askew and his face split by a grin that made him look about twelve years old. Behind him, Wilem followed at a more dignified pace, though I caught the hint of a smile on his dark features.

Simmon reached me and threw his arms around my shoulders with enough force to nearly knock me off my feet. I felt my body respond automatically—hands rising to find pressure points, feet shifting to sweep his legs—and I forced myself to stop. To simply accept the embrace of a friend.

"Tehlu's teeth, Sim," I said, returning the hug with an awkwardness that I hoped he wouldn't notice. "You'd think I'd been gone for years."

"Four months," he said, pulling back to look at me. "Do you know what four months is like without someone to set fire to things and antagonize the Masters and generally make life interesting? It's been *boring*, Kvothe. Tragically, terminally boring."

"I'm touched that my primary value to you is as an agent of chaos."

"Don't forget the music," Wilem said, arriving and clasping my hand. His grip was firm, his eyes sharp. Of the two of them, Wil had always been the more observant, and I could see him cataloging the changes: the way I held myself differently, the new calluses on my hands, the subtle tension in my shoulders that came from months of expecting attack from any angle.

"You've been training," he said quietly. Not a question.

"Among other things."

Simmon, oblivious as always to the undercurrents, was already talking about what had happened in my absence. "—and Ambrose has been insufferable, naturally. Telling everyone you were expelled, or dead, or both. I think he was genuinely disappointed when he heard you were coming back. He'll have to think of new things to say about you now."

"Will he," I said, and something in my voice made Simmon's cheerful expression falter.

There was a moment of silence between us, filled only by the sounds of the University going about its business.

"Kvothe," Wilem said carefully. "What happened out there?"

I looked at my friends—these two men who had given me money when I was starving, shelter when I was homeless, trust when I had done nothing to earn it. I thought about telling them everything. About the Chandrian, the Cthaeh, the poison words that even now were spreading through my future like ink through water.

But some knowledge is a weapon that cuts whoever holds it. And I had already made too many people into targets.

"I learned some things," I said. "Important things. And I found some answers I've been looking for."

"About your parents?" Simmon asked softly. He knew something of my history—I had told them a little, though never the full truth.

"Yes." The word came out harder than I intended. "About them. About the ones who killed them."

*Killed*. Not "who died." Not "who were lost." Killed. It was the first time I had been so direct with them, and I saw understanding dawn in their eyes. Simmon went pale. Wilem's expression hardened into something fierce.

"Kvothe," Wil said, his hand settling on my shoulder, "what are you going to do?"

I smiled, and I knew it was not a kind smile. I knew it was the smile of a man who had survived Tarbean's streets, who had burned down Trebon, who had walked into the Fae and walked out again carrying secrets that could shake the world.

"I'm going to find them," I said. "And when I do, I'm going to make them answer for what they've done."

---

We went to Anker's.

It was, perhaps, exactly the wrong choice. But I had spent months in the Fae where time moved strangely, and before that I had spent months in Vintas playing at politics with the Maer. I wanted something familiar. I wanted cheap beer and wooden benches and the comfortable rhythm of conversation with friends.

What I got was a reminder of how much I had changed.

The common room was crowded, filled with students whose faces I half-recognized. We found a table in the corner, and Simmon immediately began ordering enough metheglin to drown a small horse. The familiar smell of it—honey and spices and warmth—should have been comforting.

Instead, I found myself calculating the angles of attack from every entrance, noting which students might be threats, identifying the best routes of escape should I need them. The Adem training had become automatic, a constant awareness that hummed beneath every other thought.

"So," Simmon said, settling into his chair with the satisfaction of a man who has his friend back and a drink in front of him, "tell us everything. They said you went into the Fae. They said you fought bandits in the Eld. They said—"

"Half of what they say is lies," I said, taking a sip of metheglin. It tasted like memory—like the boy I had been before I learned that nightmares walked the world in daylight. "And the other half is worse."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning the truth is usually stranger than the stories." I paused, considering how much to tell them. "I did go to the Fae. And yes, I spent time with Felurian."

Simmon's eyes went wide. "Felurian. *The* Felurian? The one from the songs, who drives men mad and—"

"The same."

"And you're not mad?"

I laughed, though there was little humor in it. "That remains to be seen."

Wilem was watching me with those careful eyes. "How did you escape her?"

"I named the wind," I said simply. "And I made her a promise."

Neither of them asked what the promise was. Perhaps they could see in my face that it was not something I wished to discuss.

"After that," I continued, "I went to the Adem. The mercenaries in the Stormwal mountains—you've heard of them?"

"The ones who don't speak?" Simmon asked. "Who can kill a man with their bare hands?"

"They speak. Just not with words, mostly." I held up my hands, showing them the subtle positioning that meant *amusement* and *patience* in the Adem gesture-language. "They taught me the Ketan. Their fighting style."

"Show us," Simmon said immediately.

"This is not a tavern trick, Sim."

"No, I mean it. I want to see."

I shook my head, but there was no real resistance in me. Perhaps I wanted to show them. Perhaps I wanted them to understand that the person who had left was not the person who had returned.

I stood from the table in a single smooth motion, and even that was different—the Adem moved like water, like wind, and after months of training it had become unconscious. A few students at nearby tables glanced over, curious.

"Kvothe—" Wilem started.

But I was already moving.

The Ketan is not meant for performance. It is not a dance or a display. It is a language of the body, a conversation between you and violence itself. But there are forms within it that can be shown without danger, and I moved through them now: Breaking Lion, Maiden Dancing, The Wind Turning a Leaf.

I felt my body respond with the precision the Adem had beaten into me over weeks of endless training. My feet found their positions without thought. My hands moved through patterns that could redirect force or deliver death, depending on intent. The sword at my hip was unnecessary—after the Ketan, any part of the body could be a weapon.

When I stopped, the nearby tables had gone quiet. A dozen students were staring at me with expressions ranging from awe to confusion to something that might have been fear.

"Tehlu's bloody feet," Simmon breathed.

I sat down, feeling suddenly self-conscious. "The Adem are thorough teachers."

"That's... Kvothe, that was..." Simmon seemed to be struggling for words. "You moved like you weren't entirely human."

"The Adem say that anyone can learn the Ketan," I said, taking another drink. "But few outsiders have the patience."

"Or the talent," Wilem added. His voice was thoughtful, and I could see him reassessing me. "That's not just training. That's..."

"It's what I needed," I said flatly. "For what comes next."

The conversation stuttered after that. Simmon tried to revive it with gossip about the University—who was sleeping with whom, which Masters were feuding, how much Ambrose had paid to have a poem written about himself—but there was a distance between us now that hadn't existed before. A gulf that couldn't be bridged by metheglin and old jokes.

I had always been different from my friends. I was Edema Ruh, the poor boy among nobles. I was the prodigy, the exception, the one who didn't quite fit. But this was something new. This was the difference between someone who has seen the shape of the world and someone who still believes the maps.

Eventually, Simmon made his excuses and left—early class tomorrow, he said, though we all knew that wasn't the real reason. Wilem stayed a moment longer, looking at me across the table with an expression I couldn't quite read.

"You're hunting them," he said quietly. "The ones who killed your family."

"Yes."

"And you think you can find them?"

I thought about the Adem rhyme, the one that gave the names and signs of the Chandrian. *Cyphus bears the blue flame. Stercus is in thrall of iron. Ferule chill and dark of eye.* I thought about the Cthaeh's words, poisoned truths that had been working their way through me since the moment I heard them.

"I know things now that I didn't know before," I said. "I know their names. I know their signs. I know that they've been hiding for a thousand years because knowledge is dangerous to them."

"And that doesn't worry you? That beings who have survived a thousand years might be more than a match for even Kvothe the Arcane?"

I smiled—a real smile this time, though not a happy one. "Wil, I'm counting on it. I'm counting on them not expecting anyone to put the pieces together, to be angry enough and clever enough to find them. They've been living in the shadows for so long that they've forgotten what it's like to have someone hunt *them*."

Wilem was quiet for a long moment. Then he reached across the table and gripped my hand, his dark eyes meeting mine.

"Be careful," he said. "Not for your sake—I know you too well for that. But for the sake of the people who love you. Don't make us mourn someone who was too clever to ask for help."

He left me there, sitting alone in Anker's with a half-empty cup and a heart full of things I couldn't say.

---

I walked back to the Mews in the cool darkness, my footsteps silent on the cobblestones.

The University at night was a different creature than the University by day. The students were gone, tucked into their rooms with their books and their candles and their innocent dreams. The buildings rose like sleeping giants, their windows dark, their secrets hidden.

I found myself stopping at the Archives.

The great stone building squatted at the center of the University like a vast beast, holding within its walls more knowledge than any living person could hope to consume in a hundred lifetimes. Lorren, the Master Archivist, had given me back my access before I left—a gesture that had seemed generous at the time.

Now I wondered if it had been something else. A test, perhaps. Or a trap.

Because there were books in the Archives about the Chandrian. Or rather, there *had* been books. Every time I searched, every time I thought I was close, the references led to missing volumes, to pages torn from older texts, to conspicuous absences in the catalog that screamed of deliberate removal.

Someone had been erasing the Chandrian from history for a very long time.

The Amyr, I thought. The ancient order that Lorren had told me was disbanded two hundred years ago, though I had found evidence that they had existed for far longer. The order whose motto was *Atas Entas*, "for the greater good."

What greater good could require the destruction of knowledge? What purpose could be served by making the Chandrian into nothing more than children's stories?

Unless the purpose was protection. Not of the Chandrian, but of the world.

I stared at the Archives for a long moment, feeling the weight of the secrets it contained. Secrets I would find, whatever the cost.

Then I turned and walked to my room, and if my dreams that night were troubled by blue flame and the rustle of ancient pages, I told myself it was only the metheglin.

*The innkeeper paused in his telling, his hands wrapped around a cup of cider that had long since gone cold.*

*"That was my first day back," he said. "That was the beginning of the ending. I could feel it even then—the way the threads were tightening around me. The Cthaeh had spoken, and everything I did from that moment was part of its design."*

*Chronicler looked up from his paper. "You make it sound inevitable. Like you had no choice."*

*"Did I?" Kote's voice was soft. "Does a river choose to flow downhill? Does flame choose to burn? I was what the world had made me: a weapon pointed at a target. The only question was how much damage I would do before I struck."*

*Bast shifted uneasily in his chair. "Reshi..."*

*"The Adem have a saying," Kote continued, as if he hadn't heard. "The Lethani is not a path. It is a way of walking. I thought I understood what that meant. I thought the Lethani would guide me toward righteousness, toward justice."*

*He laughed, and the sound was hollow.*

*"I was wrong. The Lethani doesn't care about justice. It cares about right action. And sometimes the right action is terrible. Sometimes the right action is the one that destroys everything you love."*

*The fire crackled in the silence that followed, and outside, the wind rose against the windows like something trying to get in.*
