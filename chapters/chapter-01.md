# Chapter One: The Third Day

---

It was the third day, and the silence had changed.

The Waystone Inn lay quiet as a patient dying, its common room holding the dim light of late morning like a cupped hand holds water—carelessly, letting it slip through the cracks. The bar, with its countless bottles, caught and scattered what light there was, creating little sparks of amber and emerald that moved like will-o'-the-wisps when no one was watching.

The innkeeper stood behind the bar, polishing a glass that was already clean. His motions were automatic, practiced, the movements of a man who has polished so many glasses that his hands no longer require instruction from his mind. He was not a handsome man. In the dim light, his face looked hollow, carved from something harder than flesh. His eyes, when they caught the light, showed nothing—not because they were empty, but because whatever was inside them had been locked away.

Kote. That was his name, or at least the name he wore now like an ill-fitting coat.

At a corner table, two men sat surrounded by papers and scattered pens. One was tall and thin, with the predatory focus of a hawk. The other was younger, with dark hair and eyes that shifted between terror and fascination with the casual ease of a man watching a building burn.

The tall one was Chronicler. The young one was Bast.

"You understand," Kote said, setting down the glass with exquisite care, "that today will be harder."

It was not a question. Chronicler set down his pen and rubbed his eyes. They had been at this for two days already—two days of impossible tales told in the quiet voice of a man who had stopped believing in his own legend. Two days of Kvothe becoming Kote and back again, the transformations so subtle that Chronicler sometimes wondered if he was imagining them.

"I understood that from the beginning," Chronicler said carefully. "I'm not here for the easy parts."

Bast made a sound that might have been a laugh, if laughs could be carved from worry. "The easy parts," he repeated. "Yes. Certainly. The child whose parents were murdered, the boy who lived like an animal in the streets, the young man who fought and bled and burned—those were the easy parts."

"Bast." Kote's voice was soft, but something in it made the young man fall silent. Not fear, exactly. Respect, perhaps. Or love so tangled with grief that it had become something else entirely.

The innkeeper came around the bar, his footsteps making almost no sound on the wooden floor. He moved like a man carrying something fragile and impossibly heavy—not in his arms, but somewhere deeper. He sat in the chair across from Chronicler, and for a moment, his eyes caught the light in a way that made them seem green.

"Yesterday, I told you about the Adem," Kote said. "About Felurian. About the Cthaeh, though I wish I could forget." He paused, and when he spoke again, his voice had changed—becoming richer, more resonant, as if remembering was the same as becoming. "Today I tell you about the things that ended. About doors that shouldn't be opened. About the king I killed, and why."

Chronicler's pen hovered over fresh paper. "And about her?"

The silence that followed was different from the silences that had come before. This one had weight. It settled over the room like dust over forgotten furniture, and in it, even the bottles on the shelf seemed to hold their breath.

"Yes," Kote said finally. "About her."

I returned to the University in the late days of autumn, when the leaves were just beginning to burn.

It's a strange thing, returning to a place that shaped you. The buildings looked the same—the Masters' Hall with its stern grey stones, the Fishery billowing its perpetual breath of smoke and wonder, the Archives squatting like a great blind thing filled with all the words ever written. But the shapes felt smaller now, as if the months I'd been away had stretched them, or perhaps shrunk me to fit the scale of the wider world I'd seen.

Or perhaps the change was simpler than that. Perhaps the University looked different because I was no longer just a student seeking knowledge. I was a weapon seeking a target.

I made my way through the familiar streets of Imre, past the Eolian where I'd once played for talent pipes, past the fountain where Denna and I had spoken of ten thousand things and none of the ones that mattered. The afternoon light was golden, thick as honey, and the students passing me seemed impossibly young—children playing at the edges of powers they didn't understand.

Had I ever been that young? I must have been. But the boy who had arrived at these gates three years ago, half-starved and desperate, carrying nothing but his father's lute and a burning need to understand—that boy felt like someone I had read about in a book. A character. A fiction.

What arrived at the University that autumn afternoon was something else.

The Adem had given me the names of the Seven, each one a weapon sharper than the sword at my hip. The Cthaeh had given me knowledge I couldn't unlearn, poisoned truths that spread through my mind like ink through water. Felurian had given me... well. What she had given me was not something I spoke of casually.

But more than any of that, what I carried back to the University was certainty. I knew, with the bone-deep knowledge that comes from brushing against ancient things, that my parents' killers were real. That they could be found. That they could be hurt.

I was so certain. Looking back, that certainty feels like a fever—brilliant and consuming and ultimately destructive. But at the time, it felt like truth. The only truth worth having.

Simmon found me before I'd even reached the Mews.

"Kvothe!" His voice carried across the courtyard, bright and genuine as a hunting horn. He was running toward me with that ungainly enthusiasm he'd never quite grown out of, his noble's clothes slightly disheveled, his face split by a grin. "Kvothe, you impossible bastard, you're back!"

Before I could respond, he'd caught me in an embrace that drove the breath from my lungs. Over his shoulder, I saw Wilem approaching at a more dignified pace, his dark face wearing its usual expression of fond exasperation.

"We heard stories," Simmon said, pulling back to look at me with something like awe. "They said you'd gone into the Fae. They said you fought bandits in the Eld. They said—"

"Half of what they say is lies," I told him, "and the other half is worse."

"That's what I told him," Wilem said, clasping my hand in greeting. His grip was firm, his eyes searching my face with the careful attention of a good friend who suspects something has changed. "I said the truth was probably much more boring than bandits and fair folk."

"It wasn't boring," I said. "But it wasn't quite what the stories say, either."

There was a moment then—brief, easily missed—where something passed between us. Wilem had always been the more perceptive of my friends, and I could see him cataloguing the differences: the way I stood, the way I moved, the way my eyes didn't quite meet his. He didn't ask. He wouldn't. That was the sort of friend Wilem was.

"Well," Simmon said, breaking the silence with determined cheerfulness, "whatever happened, it's good to have you back. Things have been terribly dull without someone setting fire to things and dueling nobles."

"I didn't duel—" I started.

"Ambrose has been insufferable," Simmon continued, ignoring me. "Even more than usual. He's been telling everyone you were expelled, or dead, or both. I think he was genuinely disappointed when he heard you were coming back."

"Was he," I said, and something in my voice made Simmon's smile falter.

"Kvothe." Wilem's hand settled on my shoulder, the grip gentle but firm. "What happened out there?"

I looked at my friends—these two men who had stood by me through so much, who had given me money and shelter and something even rarer: trust freely offered. I thought about telling them. About the Chandrian, the Cthaeh, the things I now knew about doors and names and the weight of ancient malice.

But some knowledge is too heavy to share. And I had already made too many people targets by telling them things they didn't need to know.

"I learned some things," I said carefully. "Important things. And I found some answers I've been looking for."

"About your parents?" Simmon asked quietly. He knew, of course—I had told them something of my past, though not everything. Never everything.

"Yes," I said. "About them. About the ones who killed them."

The word hung in the air between us: *killed*. Not "died," not "were lost." Killed. It was the first time I had been so explicit with them, and I saw understanding dawn in their eyes. Simmon went pale; Wilem's expression hardened into something like anger on my behalf.

"Kvothe," Simmon said slowly, "what are you going to do?"

I smiled, and I knew it wasn't a kind smile. I knew it was the smile of a man who had spent three years in Tarbean's alleys, who had burned down a town, who had walked into the Fae and walked out again carrying secrets that could shake the world.

"I'm going to find them," I said. "And when I do, I'm going to make them answer for what they've done."

That night, I dreamed of my mother singing.

She was sitting by a fire—not our troupe's campfire, but something else, something older. Her voice rose and fell with the music of the flames, and though I couldn't quite make out the words, I recognized the song. It was one she had sung to me as a child, a song about the boy who loved the moon.

But something was wrong. Her voice kept catching, skipping like a stone across water. And when I looked closer, I saw that the fire wasn't orange and gold—it was blue. That terrible blue that haunts my memories, the color of flame that has touched something it should not touch.

"Mother," I tried to say, but my voice wouldn't come.

She turned to look at me, and her eyes were the eyes of the Cthaeh: ancient, knowing, filled with perfect malice. "You shouldn't have come back," she said, and her voice was the creak of branches, the rustle of leaves that hide things best left hidden. "Everything you do is already done. Every choice you make was made before you were born."

"That's not true," I said, but the words felt hollow even as I spoke them.

She smiled—my mother's smile on the Cthaeh's face—and said: "Ask the wind. Ask the stone. Ask the doors that were made to stay shut."

Then she opened her mouth to sing again, and what came out was silence.

I woke gasping, my hand reaching for a sword that wasn't there. The narrow bed in my room at the Mews seemed impossibly cramped after months of sleeping under open skies, and the darkness pressed against me like a living thing.

*Ask the doors that were made to stay shut.*

I lay there until the first grey light of dawn crept through my window, thinking about doors. About the one in the Archives that I had never been allowed to open. About the ones hidden in family rhymes and children's songs. About the one that I could feel, somewhere in the depths of my mind, waiting to be found.

Waiting to be opened.

In the distance, I heard the bells of the University marking the hour. A new day. A new term. A new Kvothe, returned from the edges of the world carrying weapons that would burn everything they touched.

I didn't know it then—not truly—but the end had already begun.

---

*The Waystone Inn fell silent as the innkeeper's voice trailed off. Outside, the wind had risen, pressing against the windows like something trying to get in. Or perhaps something trying to get out.*

*"That's where it started," Kote said softly. "The return. The seeking. The doors that should have stayed closed." He looked at his hands—innkeeper's hands now, rough and work-worn—as if seeing something else. "If I had known then what I know now... would I have done anything different?"*

*He laughed, and the sound was hollow. "Probably not. That's the cruel joke of it all. Even knowing the end, I would have walked the same path. That's what the Cthaeh understood about me. That's what made me perfect."*

*"Perfect for what?" Chronicler asked.*

*The innkeeper looked up, and for just a moment, his eyes were green—brilliant green, the color of spring leaves, the color of a flame burning too hot.*

*"Perfect for ruin," he said. "The greatest weapon is a man who is certain he is right."*
