# Chapter Four: Denna

---

Love is a strange thing. It is the closest we come to magic that does not require sympathy or naming or binding. It is the closest we come to being something other than what we are.

But love is also a kind of blindness. And the things we cannot see are the things most likely to destroy us.

I saw her across a crowded room.

It sounds like the beginning of a song, doesn't it? That's because it is—a thousand songs, a million songs, every story ever told about a man and a woman and the space between them. But songs don't capture what it's like, not really. Songs give you the melody without the dissonance, the harmony without the ache.

When I saw Denna across the common room of the Eolian, what I felt was not the sweet pang of a love song. It was something rawer, something that had teeth.

She was different. That was the first thing I noticed. She had always been beautiful—beautifully as a fire is beautiful, beautifully as a blade is beautiful—but there was something new in the way she held herself. More confidence. More certainty. She stood at the center of a small group of admirers, and instead of deflecting their attention the way she once had, she seemed to gather it around herself like a cloak.

And her hair. God's mother, her hair.

It was elaborately braided, woven into patterns I had never seen before. Patterns that seemed to shift as I watched them, that drew the eye and held it and made you forget what you had been thinking. I found myself staring, and I did not know why.

Then she turned, and our eyes met.

For a moment, neither of us moved. The crowded room seemed to fall away, and there was only her face and my heartbeat and the distance between us that had always been too great to cross.

Then she smiled—that smile I had dreamed about for months, the smile that made her seem both younger and older at once—and she began walking toward me.

"Kvothe," she said.

"Denna."

We stood there, close enough to touch, not touching. The silence between us was full of things we couldn't say.

"You've been away," she said finally.

"So have you."

A shadow crossed her face, there and gone. "I heard stories. About the Fae. About Felurian."

"Stories are rarely accurate."

"These ones sounded accurate enough." She tilted her head, studying me the way she used to when she was trying to solve a puzzle. "You look different."

"So do you."

She laughed, and the sound was both familiar and strange. The old Denna had laughed like she was surprised by her own joy. This Denna laughed like she knew exactly what she was doing.

"I've learned some things," she said. "While you were away."

"What sort of things?"

But she only smiled and took my arm, steering me toward a table in the corner where we could talk without being overheard.

---

We talked for hours.

Or rather, we danced around talking. We exchanged news—surface news, safe news—about where we had been and what we had done. She spoke of traveling, of a patron who had taught her more than she had ever expected to learn. I spoke of the Adem, of Ademre and the Ketan, of things that were true but incomplete.

Neither of us mentioned the things that mattered.

I wanted to ask about Master Ash. About the patron who beat her, who had given her the ring she still wore on her finger, who had commissioned her song about Lanre. But every time I approached the subject, she deflected with a joke or a question or a sudden fascination with something across the room.

She wanted to ask about the Fae. About Felurian. About things I could see burning behind her eyes every time she looked at me. But she didn't, and I was grateful, because I didn't know how to answer.

What could I say? That I had held a goddess in my arms and walked away? That I had loved Felurian as much as it was possible to love someone who was not entirely human, and that leaving her had felt like tearing out a piece of myself?

What could I say? That even now, sitting across from Denna, I could feel the pull of the Fae like a wound that hadn't healed?

"Play for me," Denna said suddenly.

I blinked. "What?"

"Play for me. It's been so long since I heard you play. I want to—" She stopped, and for a moment I saw something vulnerable beneath the confidence. "I want to remember what it sounded like."

The Eolian had a lute I could borrow. I had earned my talent pipes here, once. The owner, Deoch, was happy to provide an instrument for Kvothe the Arcane, Kvothe the Bloodless, the young man who had once played The Lay of Sir Savien and made the room weep.

But when I held the lute in my hands, something was wrong.

My fingers knew the positions. My mind knew the music. But there was a disconnect between what I intended and what emerged—a flatness, a hesitation, as if the lute was a stranger I had once known intimately and now could barely recognize.

The Adem did not value music. In Ademre, song was seen as a kind of weakness, an expression of the emotions they had trained themselves to control. For months, I had not played. For months, I had been learning to move and fight and kill, to suppress the feelings that music both required and produced.

I played anyway. I played a song I had written for Denna years ago, a song without words that said everything I had never been able to say. But the notes came out thin, uncertain, lacking the emotion that had once flowed through me like water through a channel.

When I finished, Denna was quiet.

"That was beautiful," she said, but her eyes said something else. Her eyes said: *What happened to you?*

I set down the lute. "I've been... away from music. For a while."

"I know." She reached across the table and touched my hand, and the contact was electric. "I can hear it. You're holding back. You're—" She paused, searching for the word. "Controlled."

"Is that bad?"

"I don't know." She withdrew her hand, and the absence of her touch was like a cold wind. "I used to love watching you play because you put everything into it. Everything you felt, everything you were. It was like watching someone set themselves on fire and enjoy it."

"Maybe I've learned that fire burns."

"Maybe." She was quiet for a moment. "Or maybe you've just forgotten why it was worth burning."

---

We walked along the Omethi River as the night deepened, the water black and silver beneath the incomplete moon.

"I'm working on something," Denna said. "A song. The most important thing I've ever written."

"Tell me about it."

She was quiet for a long moment, and I could see her wrestling with herself. "It's about Lanre. The hero who became Haliax."

My heart stopped. Then started again, beating too fast.

"Lanre," I said, keeping my voice carefully neutral.

"My patron commissioned it. He's—" She hesitated. "He's been teaching me things, Kvothe. Things about history, about magic, about the way stories shape the world. This song... it's not like anything I've written before. It has *power* in it."

"What kind of power?"

She smiled, and there was pride in it. "I've learned to weave yllish knots into my lyrics. Written magic, they call it. When I sing this song, people don't just hear it—they *feel* it. They believe it."

I thought about the braids in her hair. The patterns that seemed to shift and catch the eye. Written magic.

"What does the song say about Lanre?"

"It says the truth." Her voice was fervent. "Not the Amyr's version, not the sanitized story that the Church has been spreading for a thousand years. The real truth. Lanre was a hero, Kvothe. He saved the world from something terrible—something worse than anyone remembers. And when he destroyed the cities, it wasn't betrayal. It was *sacrifice*. He was trying to prevent an even greater catastrophe."

I felt cold. So cold.

"Denna," I said carefully, "where did your patron get this version of the story?"

"From sources. Old sources. The Amyr have been lying to everyone for centuries, rewriting history to make themselves look like heroes and Lanre look like a monster. But my patron found the truth, and he wants me to spread it. To sing it in every tavern and every court until the real story is known."

"And you believe him?"

She turned to face me, and her eyes were bright with conviction. "I believe the evidence. I've seen the texts, Kvothe. I've read the old records that the Amyr tried to destroy. Lanre wasn't evil. He was desperate. He was trying to save what he loved, and he failed, and the people who won got to write the history."

I wanted to tell her. God, I wanted to tell her everything.

About my parents, burning while Cinder laughed. About the Cthaeh, whispering poison in the branches of its tree. About the Adem rhyme that named the Chandrian, that identified Cinder by his cold eyes and Haliax by his shadow-haliax-his calling name.

But if I told her the truth, I would have to tell her about Master Ash. I would have to tell her that her patron, the one who had given her power and confidence and a purpose, was almost certainly a monster wearing a human face.

And she would not believe me. She would think I was jealous, controlling, trying to take away the one thing that had made her feel strong.

"Just be careful," I said instead. "Powerful people have died for knowing less than what you're singing about."

"I know." She reached up and touched her hair, her fingers tracing one of the elaborate braids. "But I'm not powerless anymore. I can protect myself."

*Can you?* I wanted to ask. *Can anyone protect themselves from something they don't know exists?*

But I said nothing. And the silence between us grew until it was wider than the river.

---

I walked her back to her lodgings, a boarding house near the Eolian where she kept a small room.

"I've missed you," she said at the door. Her voice was soft, uncertain—more like the old Denna than the confident woman I had been talking to all night. "I know we've never been... I know things have always been complicated between us. But I missed you, Kvothe."

"I missed you too."

We stood there, close enough to touch, not touching. The moon had set, and the street was dark except for the distant glow of sympathy lamps.

"When I was in the Fae," I said, "I thought about you. Felurian asked me about you, once. She asked who I loved, and I couldn't—" I stopped, not sure what I was trying to say. "I couldn't answer her. Because the answer was too complicated."

Denna laughed softly. "We've always been too complicated, haven't we?"

"Yes."

"Maybe that's why it works. Or doesn't work. Or whatever it is we do."

I reached out and touched her face, and she closed her eyes, leaning into my hand. The contact was electric, charged with everything we had never said.

"Your hair," I murmured. "The braids. They're beautiful, but they're also—"

"Magic?" She opened her eyes, and there was a glint of mischief in them. "Yes. I told you, I've been learning. The patterns are yllish. They say things. Do you want to know what this one says?"

I traced one of the braids with my fingertips, feeling the complexity of the weave. "What does it say?"

"It says 'lovely.'" She smiled. "When people look at me, they see what the braid tells them to see. They see beauty."

"You don't need magic to be beautiful, Denna."

"Maybe not." She caught my hand and held it against her cheek. "But I need magic to be safe. I need magic to be powerful. For the first time in my life, I'm not just surviving—I'm *choosing*. I'm deciding what my life will be, instead of letting life decide for me."

"And your patron gave you that?"

"Yes." Her voice was firm, certain. "He gave me that."

I wanted to tell her that gifts from dangerous people always come with a price. I wanted to tell her that the power she was so proud of was being used to spread lies about the most dangerous beings in the world. I wanted to tell her that Master Ash—Cinder—had killed my family and was now using her to rewrite history in his favor.

But I looked at her face, glowing with confidence and purpose, and I couldn't do it. I couldn't be the one to take that away from her.

"Be careful," I said again, knowing it wasn't enough. "Please, Denna. Be careful."

"I always am." She kissed my hand, then released it and stepped back. "Goodnight, Kvothe. Come hear me sing sometime. I'll be performing the new song at the Eolian next span. You'll see—it's going to change everything."

She went inside, and I stood alone in the dark street, feeling the weight of everything I hadn't said pressing down on me like stone.

*"You didn't tell her," Chronicler said. It wasn't a question.*

*"No." Kote's voice was distant. "I didn't tell her."*

*"Why not?"*

*The innkeeper was silent for a long moment. "Because I was a coward. Because I was afraid of losing her. Because I thought I could find another way—a way to save her without destroying her faith in herself." He laughed bitterly. "I was wrong about many things in those days, but that might have been the worst. If I had told her the truth that night, everything might have been different. She might have listened. She might have doubted. She might have—"*

*He stopped, his hands gripping the edge of the table.*

*"But I didn't. And by the time I finally told her, it was too late. She had made her choice. She had chosen him."*

*Bast leaned forward. "Reshi... the song she was writing. The one about Lanre. Did she finish it?"*

*"Oh yes." Kote's voice was hollow. "She finished it. And she sang it across the Four Corners, and people wept and believed and loved the Chandrian for the tragic heroes Denna made them seem. By the time I understood what was happening, the song had spread like a fire through dry grass. You can still hear it, sometimes, in taverns in remote places. 'The Fall of Myr Tariniel, as Written by the Seer of the Moonless Sky.'"*

*"That's Denna's song?"*

*"That's Denna's song." He stood and walked to the window again, staring out at the darkness. "And it's still doing the Chandrian's work, even now. Even after everything. The most beautiful thing she ever created, and it was a weapon she didn't know she was wielding."*

*Outside, the wind rose, and somewhere in the distance, a scrael keened.*
