## KVOTHE'S STORY

I returned to the University believing I finally had the tools to find the Chandrian. The Adem had given me their names and signs—knowledge that had been hidden for millennia. I thought I was close. I was a fool.

The Amyr found me first. I had spent so long searching for them, imagining them as allies against the Chandrian, that I never considered they might see *me* as the enemy. Lorren—quiet, protective Lorren—revealed himself as one of their number. They had been watching me since I first asked about the Chandrian in his Archives. To them, I wasn't a weapon to be aimed; I was a threat to be contained.

They gave me a choice: submit or be destroyed. I chose neither. I chose to keep searching.

That search led me to the truth about Denna's patron. Master Ash. The man who beat her, who shaped her music, who taught her written magic I didn't know existed. He was Cinder. *My* Cinder. The one who smiled while my mother burned.

I tried to save her. I told her everything—the Chandrian, my family, what her patron truly was. She looked at me like I was mad. Like I was just another man trying to control her life. She said my obsession was no different from his possession. She chose him over me.

I lost her because I couldn't see her as anything but someone who needed saving. The irony is that she was right.

After that, nothing mattered except the door. I was Natalia Lackless's son, and the Lackless secrets were my birthright. I found the door. I opened it. I thought I was finally going to end the Chandrian.

Instead, I ended the world.

The king died by my hand—I was manipulated, but it was still my hand. The war started because of what I released. Everything the Cthaeh told me came true, not because it could see the future, but because it could see *me*. It knew exactly what I would do with every piece of truth it gave me.

In the end, I did the only thing I could. I spoke my own name—not to call it, but to lock it away. I became Kote. I became silence. I became a man waiting to die.

But the story isn't over. Bast brought Chronicler here for a reason. The scrael are coming. And somewhere, in a chest I cannot open, the rest of me is waiting.

## DENNA'S STORY

I never asked to be anyone's mystery.

For years I drifted between cities, between patrons, between names. None of them saw me—they saw a beautiful face, a sweet voice, an ornament for their halls. Then I met him. Not Kvothe—the other one. Master Ash.

He was different. He didn't want to own me. He wanted to teach me. He showed me that music could be more than sound—that the right words in the right pattern could *do* things. Yllish knots woven into lyrics. Magic that didn't require sympathy or binding. Magic that was mine.

He helped me write my song. The true story of Lanre, he said—a hero betrayed by those he trusted, driven to terrible acts by grief beyond bearing. I didn't know why it mattered to him. I didn't ask. I had learned that patrons' secrets were better left unexplored.

Then Kvothe came to me with his accusations.

He said my patron was a monster. A Chandrian. The same creature who killed his parents. He wanted me to abandon everything I'd built, everyone I'd trusted, on his word alone. And when I hesitated—when I asked for proof, for time, for anything but his desperate insistence—he looked at me like I had betrayed him.

I loved Kvothe. I think I always will. But I will not be possessed. Not by a patron, not by a lover, not by anyone who looks at me and sees only what I can be *for them*.

I told him his obsession had consumed him. That he wanted to save me so badly he couldn't see I didn't need saving. That his enemy wasn't my patron—his enemy was his own inability to let anything go.

We parted as strangers. Worse than strangers.

Later, when the world began to burn, I understood what he had tried to tell me. Master Ash was Cinder. My song was propaganda for monsters. My magic had been used to make the world ready for what came through those doors.

I was the weapon, and I never knew.

Now I wander again. No patron. No home. My songs are everywhere, doing harm I never intended. And somewhere, Kvothe is hiding in an inn, waiting to die, and I cannot go to him because I don't know what I would say.

*I'm sorry* seems insufficient. *I didn't know* is no excuse. And *I still love you* would only make it worse.

## BAST'S STORY

My Reshi is dying.

Not in the quick way, with blood and breath. In the slow way, the human way—a death of forgetting who you are. He calls himself Kote now. He can't play the lute. He can't call the wind. He let two common soldiers beat him in his own inn.

I've tried everything. I brought Chronicler here to make him remember. I hired those soldiers to make him fight. Nothing works. He just... accepts it. Like he deserves this death.

For three days now, he's been telling his story. I thought it would help. I thought if he remembered being Kvothe—the legend, the hero, the man who loved and fought and *mattered*—he would want to be that again.

But the story keeps getting darker. The Kvothe in his story isn't a hero. He's a disaster wearing a hero's face. Every choice leads to ruin. Every victory is actually a defeat. And the worst part is that he *knows*. He knew what he was, even as he was becoming it.

Maybe this is my failure. I wanted to restore a legend. But legends aren't people—they're stories we tell to make the world less frightening. The real Kvothe is the man in that story: brilliant, broken, destructive. Do I really want him back?

The scrael are coming. More every night. Something worse is coming behind them. The war my Reshi started is spreading, and the world needs the Kingkiller—not to kill, but to fix what he broke.

But if he becomes Kvothe again... will he fix it? Or will he make it worse?

Tonight, he reaches for the chest. The thrice-locked chest that holds whatever remains of who he was. I've seen him try before. He always stops.

This time, I don't know if I should help him open it—or stop him.

## CHRONICLER'S STORY

I came here looking for the greatest story ever told: the true life of Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, Kvothe Kingkiller. I expected adventure, romance, heroism—the stuff of legend.

What I got was a tragedy.

Three days of listening to a brilliant man explain, in precise and unsparing detail, exactly how he destroyed everything he touched. His parents. His education. His friends. The woman he loved. A king. The world.

And he doesn't flinch from any of it. He tells it straight, even the parts that make him look like a monster. Especially those parts.

I've written many stories. I know how people shape their own narratives, how they cast themselves as heroes even when they're clearly villains. Kvothe doesn't do that. If anything, he's harder on himself than the facts require. He takes responsibility for things that weren't entirely his fault.

Bast wants me to focus on the heroic parts. He thinks if Kvothe remembers being great, he'll be great again. But I don't think that's how it works. I think Kvothe remembers too well. He knows exactly who he was, and he can't bear to be that person again.

The question I can't stop asking: is his story a warning or a confession?

When a hero tells you he's really a villain, do you believe him? Or do you look for the redemption he's too broken to see in himself?

The scrael are massing outside. Something is coming. And the only man who might be able to stop it is sitting across from me, reaching for a chest he cannot open, telling himself he's nobody special.

I don't know how this story ends. But I'm going to write it down anyway, because someone should know the truth.

Even if the truth is that there are no heroes. Only people doing their best, and usually failing, and occasionally burning down the world.

## CINDER'S STORY

Seven thousand years is a long time to hate someone.

We were different once. Lanre was our leader, our brother in arms, the best of us. When Lyra died, something in him broke. And when he discovered the truth behind the Creation War—who was really pulling the strings, what was really at stake—he made a choice that damned us all.

Now we are the Chandrian. We cannot die. We cannot hide. Our very presence leaves signs that betray us to those who know how to look. And always, always, the Amyr and the Sithe hunt us.

Do you know what it's like to exist for seven thousand years with nothing to do but run and hide and be reviled?

The girl was supposed to be a tool. Denna. I taught her to weave power into music, and she was good—better than I expected. Her song about Lanre would have spread across the Four Corners, changing the story, making people understand that we were not monsters but victims. In a few generations, the hatred might have faded.

But her little red-haired lover had to interfere. Kvothe. The son of Arliden, who asked too many questions. We killed his troupe to silence one man's curiosity, and instead we created an enemy who would never stop.

He found the door. He opened it. What came out... even I didn't expect that. Haliax seemed almost pleased, but Haliax has his own goals, his own ancient hatreds. I just wanted to rest.

Instead, there's war again. There's chaos. The scrael are loose in the mortal world. And somewhere, in a quiet inn in the middle of nowhere, Kvothe is telling his story.

I wonder if he knows he won. Not over the Chandrian—we're still here. But over himself. He locked away everything that made him dangerous. He chose silence over destruction.

That's more than any of us ever managed.
