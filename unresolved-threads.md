## How to Use This Document

Each mystery is assigned a unique ID (Q001, Q002, etc.) for tracking across all project documents. The "Questions Addressed" sections in our snowflake outline documents reference these IDs to show which mysteries we resolve and how.

**Status Key:**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Must be resolved; central to the plot
- 🟠 **IMPORTANT** - Should be resolved; significant fan expectations
- 🟡 **MODERATE** - Should be addressed; adds depth and satisfaction
- 🟢 **MINOR** - Nice to address; completionist details
- ⚪ **AMBIENT** - Can remain mysterious; some things are better unexplained

# 🔥 CRITICAL MYSTERIES (Must Resolve)

## Q001 - Why Is Kvothe Now "Kote"?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Source** | NotW Ch. 1, WMF Frame |
| **The Mystery** | Kvothe, the legendary arcanist, is now a broken innkeeper who can't fight, can't do magic, and calls himself "Kote" (possibly meaning "disaster" in Siaru) |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) He changed his true Name to hide; 2) He locked away his abilities voluntarily; 3) His power was stripped by Chandrian/Amyr; 4) He's waiting to spring a trap; 5) Psychological trauma broke something in him |
| **Our Resolution** | Kvothe spoke his own true name to *lock it away*, not to call it. After causing catastrophe by opening the Doors of Stone, he sealed his power, identity, and abilities behind mental barriers to prevent himself from doing more harm. "Kote" is the diminished fragment that remains. |

## Q002 - Which King Did Kvothe Kill?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Source** | NotW Ch. 1 (title "Kingkiller"), WMF various hints |
| **The Mystery** | Kvothe is known as "Kingkiller" - which king did he kill and why? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Ambrose Jakis (becomes king through succession deaths); 2) King Roderic Calanthis of Vintas; 3) A Faen king; 4) The Maer Alveron; 5) Multiple kings; 6) A metaphorical "king" (like the moon) |
| **Our Resolution** | Kvothe killed King Roderic Calanthis. In the chaos following the opening of the Doors of Stone, Roderic arrived with his guards to investigate. The Chandrian had positioned events so that Kvothe, desperate and overwhelmed by power, would strike down the king who might have united the world against the coming darkness. It was manipulation, not malice, but Kvothe's hand delivered the blow. |
| **Where Resolved** | 02-one-paragraph-summary.md, 04-one-page-synopsis.md, 06-four-page-synopsis.md, Scene 76-77 |

## Q003 - What's Behind the Four-Plate Door?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Source** | NotW (Archives), WMF repeated mentions |
| **The Mystery** | The four-plate door in the Archives is sealed and guarded. Puppet guards it. What lies within? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Iax/Jax himself; 2) The moon or part of it; 3) Dangerous books about the Chandrian; 4) The original Amyr records; 5) A piece of the Fae realm; 6) Haliax's true name; 7) Something that must never be released |
| **Our Resolution** | The four-plate door guards the Amyr's most dangerous archives—including complete records of the Creation War, true names of the Chandrian, and the knowledge of what lies behind the Doors of Stone. The Amyr have systematically removed this information from the world, concentrating it here. It's a vault of forbidden knowledge, not a prison. |
| **Where Resolved** | 06-four-page-synopsis.md (Part 1), referenced in scene 9-10 |

## Q004 - What Are the Doors of Stone?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Source** | NotW (Skarpi's story), WMF (Felurian), Book 3 Title |
| **The Mystery** | The title of Book 3. What are they? Where are they? What do they guard or contain? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Prison of Iax; 2) Barrier between mortal world and Fae; 3) The Lackless door; 4) Multiple doors in different locations; 5) Metaphorical doors in the mind; 6) Time-sealed entrances to the Creation War era |
| **Our Resolution** | The Doors of Stone were created at the end of the Creation War to imprison the power of Iax after his physical death. They exist in multiple locations where the boundary between worlds is thin, but there is one prime/original door. The Lackless family has guarded the key and location for millennia. Opening them releases what remains of Iax's power and breaks the barrier between the mortal world and Fae. |
| **Where Resolved** | 01-one-sentence-summary.md, 02-one-paragraph-summary.md, 04-one-page-synopsis.md, 06-four-page-synopsis.md, Scenes 63-74 |

## Q005 - Who Is Denna's Patron (Master Ash)?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Source** | WMF (throughout) |
| **The Mystery** | Denna's mysterious patron who beats her, teaches her music and magic, and commissioned her Lanre song |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) **Cinder** (Ash/Cinder wordplay, present at Mauthen farm); 2) Bredon (mysterious, disappears when patron appears); 3) An Amyr operative; 4) Lorren; 5) Haliax himself; 6) A Fae noble; 7) Puppet; 8) Skarpi |
| **Our Resolution** | Master Ash is **Cinder (Ferule)**. The wordplay is deliberate: ash and cinder. He has been manipulating Denna to write a song that portrays the Chandrian sympathetically, using her written magic (yllish knots) to spread their revised history. Cinder chose Denna because of her connection to Kvothe—the son of his victim—making her a weapon against both truth and love. |
| **Where Resolved** | 02-one-paragraph-summary.md, 03-character-summaries.md, 05-character-synopses.md, Scenes 33-41 |

## Q006 - What's in the Thrice-Locked Chest?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF Frame |
| **The Mystery** | The chest in Kvothe's room has three locks and he appears unable/unwilling to open it |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) His true name written down; 2) Caesura (his sword); 3) His shaed (shadow cloak); 4) A piece of his Alar; 5) The Lackless box/key; 6) Denna's ring; 7) His lute; 8) The Name of the Wind itself |
| **Our Resolution** | The chest contains: his true name (written in his own hand), his sword Caesura, the key to the Doors of Stone, and possibly his mother's ring. These are the physical remnants of who he was. The three locks correspond to three aspects of himself he sealed away: his power (Naming), his skill (fighting/artifice), and his identity (Kvothe). He CAN open it—the locks are psychological, not mechanical—but doing so would mean becoming Kvothe again. |
| **Where Resolved** | 04-one-page-synopsis.md, 06-four-page-synopsis.md (Part 5), Scene 90 |

## Q007 - What Is the Chandrian's True Purpose?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Source** | NotW (troupe murder), WMF (Adem story) |
| **The Mystery** | Why do they exist? What do they want? Why do they hide? Why kill Kvothe's parents? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Seeking to break their curse; 2) Hiding from the Amyr/Sithe; 3) Protecting something; 4) Trying to change the narrative about themselves; 5) Agents of Iax; 6) Victims who became monsters |
| **Our Resolution** | The Chandrian are cursed remnants of the Creation War, unable to die. They seek to either break free of their curse or to rehabilitate their image so they can exist without being hunted. They killed Arliden because his song was revealing their true names and signs to the world. Their ultimate goal under Haliax is to bring about a world where they can finally rest—even if that means unleashing what lies behind the Doors of Stone. Haliax believes releasing Iax's power might end their curse. |

## Q008 - Is Kvothe's Mother Netalia Lackless?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Source** | NotW (Arliden's song, Lackless rhyme), WMF (Meluan) |
| **The Mystery** | Strong hints that Kvothe's mother Laurian was Netalia Lackless who ran away with a Ruh trouper |
| **Fan Theories** | Nearly universal agreement this is true; debate centers on implications |
| **Our Resolution** | **Confirmed.** Laurian was Netalia Lackless, eldest daughter of the family, who ran away with Arliden the bard. This makes Kvothe the heir to the Lackless family secrets—including the location and key to the Doors of Stone. His blood can open the Lackless box. His heritage is the reason the door responds to him. |
| **Where Resolved** | 04-one-page-synopsis.md, 06-four-page-synopsis.md (Part 3), Scenes 53-55 |

## Q009 - What Caused the Present-Day War?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF Frame (soldiers, refugees, scrael) |
| **The Mystery** | A war is raging in the frame story. What started it? How is Kvothe connected? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Kvothe killing the king; 2) Something released from the Fae; 3) Chandrian activity; 4) The opening of the Doors; 5) Collapse of political order |
| **Our Resolution** | The war has multiple causes, all traced to Kvothe: Opening the Doors of Stone broke the barrier between worlds, releasing dangerous creatures (scrael, worse) into the mortal realm. The king's death created a power vacuum and succession crisis. The chaos of the supernatural incursion combined with political instability ignited widespread conflict. Kvothe didn't just kill a king—he broke the world. |
| **Where Resolved** | 02-one-paragraph-summary.md, 04-one-page-synopsis.md, 06-four-page-synopsis.md (Part 4) |

## Q010 - Who/What Is the Cthaeh?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Source** | WMF (Fae) |
| **The Mystery** | A perfectly malicious, omniscient being in a tree. What is it? Where did it come from? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Iax trapped in tree form; 2) A Shaper's creation; 3) The first Namer; 4) A god or demon; 5) A manifestation of fate itself; 6) Connected to the Rhinna tree (panacea flowers) |
| **Our Resolution** | The Cthaeh is an entity from before the Creation War—possibly a Shaper or Knower who went mad with foresight. It is perfectly malicious because it can see all futures and chooses words that cause maximum harm. The Sithe guard it not to protect the Cthaeh but to prevent anyone from acting on its poison. Every word it spoke to Kvothe was designed to guide him toward opening the Doors of Stone. The Cthaeh's "truths" were the most effective weapons against Kvothe's future. |
| **Where Resolved** | 06-four-page-synopsis.md, referenced throughout as the hidden manipulator, Scenes 82-83 |

# 🟠 IMPORTANT MYSTERIES (Should Resolve)

## Q011 - Who/What Are the Amyr Really?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF (Skarpi, research, Lorren) |
| **The Mystery** | Were they disbanded? Do they still exist? Were the original Amyr non-human? What is their true purpose? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Still exist in secret; 2) Lorren is one; 3) They're the true villains; 4) They protect against something worse than Chandrian; 5) Original Amyr were angels/Ruach |
| **Our Resolution** | The Amyr never disbanded—they went underground, hiding within institutions of power. Lorren is a member. The original Amyr were non-human (Ruach who chose to fight for "the greater good"). Their true purpose is containing what lies behind the Doors of Stone. They see Kvothe as a threat because his Lackless heritage, combined with his knowledge and power, makes him capable of undoing their millennia of work. They're antagonists, but not villains—they're right about the danger Kvothe represents. |
| **Where Resolved** | 02-one-paragraph-summary.md, 04-one-page-synopsis.md, 06-four-page-synopsis.md (Part 1), Scenes 11-15 |

## Q012 - What Is Kvothe's True Name?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF (Naming discussions, Elodin) |
| **The Mystery** | Can someone know their own true name? What is Kvothe's? Did he change it? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Kvothe = Kote (diminished); 2) His name contains all his aspects (Maedre means many things); 3) He split his name; 4) He spoke it and changed himself |
| **Our Resolution** | Kvothe discovered his own true name through his Naming studies. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he spoke his own name—not to call it (which would give him power) but to *lock it away* (which sealed that power). "Kote" is what remains: a fragment, a diminished echo, "disaster" without the brilliance that caused it. His full name is locked in the chest, written in his own hand, waiting for him to choose to be whole again. |
| **Where Resolved** | 04-one-page-synopsis.md, 05-character-synopses.md, 06-four-page-synopsis.md, Scene 85-87 |

## Q013 - What Is the Lackless Box?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | WMF (Maer's possession) |
| **The Mystery** | A box with no visible seam that's been in the Lackless family for generations. What's inside? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) The key to the Doors; 2) A piece of the moon; 3) Iax's name; 4) Something from the Creation War; 5) Kvothe can open it with his blood |
| **Our Resolution** | The Lackless box contains the key to the Doors of Stone—an ancient stone inscribed with yllish knots. It opens only for Lackless blood. When Kvothe (as Lackless heir) touches it with his blood, it responds to him. The key fits the prime door and, combined with the spoken name of stone, allows passage through. |
| **Where Resolved** | 04-one-page-synopsis.md, 06-four-page-synopsis.md (Part 3), Scenes 54-56 |

## Q014 - What Do the Lackless Rhymes Mean?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF (multiple versions) |
| **The Mystery** | *"Seven things stand before / The entrance to the Lackless door..."* What are the seven things? |
| **Fan Theories** | Extensive analysis: ring unworn = name ring; word forsworn = broken promise; candle without light = unlit sympathy lamp; son who brings the blood = Kvothe; etc. |
| **Our Resolution** | The rhyme is literal instructions for opening the Doors of Stone: (1) Ring unworn = the ring of bone/name; (2) Word forsworn = the name that must not be spoken; (3) Time that must be right = the night with no moon; (4) Candle without light = bloodless sympathy; (5) Son who brings the blood = Lackless heir (Kvothe); (6) Door that holds the flood = the Doors themselves; (7) Thing tight-held in keeping = the key in the box. "That which comes with sleeping" = dreams, or death. |
| **Where Resolved** | 06-four-page-synopsis.md (Part 3), Scene 60-61 |

## Q015 - What Is Written Magic (Yllish Knots)?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | WMF (Denna's braids, Yllish study) |
| **The Mystery** | Denna's hair braids spell things. Written magic exists. How does it work? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Story-shaping magic; 2) Subtle influence on perception; 3) Yllish was the original magic language; 4) Can rewrite reality |
| **Our Resolution** | Yllish knots are a form of written magic that works by encoding meaning into physical patterns. When woven into hair, cloth, or song lyrics, they create subtle effects on perception and belief. Denna learned this from Cinder and uses it in her song about Lanre—the magic makes listeners more receptive to the sympathetic portrayal of the Chandrian. It's not as powerful as Naming but is more subtle and persistent. Her braids saying "lovely" make people perceive her as more beautiful. Her song's magic makes its alternate history feel true. |
| **Where Resolved** | 03-character-summaries.md (Denna), 06-four-page-synopsis.md (Part 2), Scenes 28-30 |

## Q016 - What Is Bast's True Agenda?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF Frame |
| **The Mystery** | Bast brought Chronicler, arranged attacks on the inn, seems desperate to "wake up" Kvothe. Why? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Pure loyalty/love; 2) He needs Kvothe for something specific; 3) He's Fae royalty with political motives; 4) The Fae realm is threatened; 5) He made a bargain |
| **Our Resolution** | Bast genuinely loves Kvothe as his teacher and friend. He's watched Kvothe slowly die for years and cannot accept it. His manipulations (bringing Chronicler, arranging the mercenary attack) are desperate attempts to shock Kvothe back to life. But as the story unfolds, Bast begins to question whether restoring Kvothe is wise—the man who opened the Doors might cause more harm than good. His arc is learning that sometimes you can't save someone from themselves. |
| **Where Resolved** | 03-character-summaries.md (Bast), 05-character-synopses.md (Bast's Story), Scene 93-95 |

## Q017 - Who Is Auri?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF, "The Slow Regard of Silent Things" |
| **The Mystery** | Auri lives in the Underthing, is clearly damaged, knows secrets. Who was she? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Princess Ariel (the story mentions "Princess Ariel"); 2) Former student who cracked; 3) Related to royalty; 4) She understands Naming at a deep level; 5) She's hiding from someone powerful |
| **Our Resolution** | Auri was a gifted student who learned too much too fast—possibly glimpsing true names that the human mind can't safely hold. Her "breaking" was similar to what happened to Elodin (who was committed to Haven). She's not mad but *different*—she perceives the world at a more fundamental level. She gives Kvothe gifts that prove crucial (the key, certain words). "Princess Ariel" may be a future story or an alias. Her full name and history remain mostly mysterious—some things are better left uncertain. |
| **Where Resolved** | Scene 19-20, referenced in 07-character-charts.md |

## Q018 - What Happened at the Mauthen Farm?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | WMF (wedding massacre) |
| **The Mystery** | A wedding was massacred. Kvothe found Chandrian signs and a survivor who mentioned Cinder. |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) The Mauthen farm had Chandrian artifacts; 2) Someone was researching them; 3) Denna's patron was there; 4) It was a message to someone |
| **Our Resolution** | The Mauthens had uncovered artifacts from the Creation War while building their new house—possibly a vase depicting the Chandrian. This drew the Chandrian themselves, who killed everyone to hide their signs. Cinder was present. Denna's patron (Cinder) used the opportunity to meet her nearby, establishing their relationship. The massacre was both pragmatic (hiding evidence) and opportunistic (recruiting Denna). |
| **Where Resolved** | Scene 32-33 (referenced in investigation) |

## Q019 - Why Do the Chandrian Fear Their Names?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | NotW (troupe murder), WMF (Adem) |
| **The Mystery** | The Chandrian killed Kvothe's troupe to stop a song revealing their names. Why fear names? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Knowing the name gives power over them; 2) Names can summon them unwillingly; 3) Names bind them to their curse; 4) The Amyr can use names to hunt them |
| **Our Resolution** | True names are power in this world. Knowing a Chandrian's true name—their full, real name—gives one the ability to call them, bind them, or potentially destroy them. The Adem rhyme and Arliden's song were spreading fragmentary knowledge that, combined, could give enemies the tools to threaten them. They don't fear the names themselves; they fear what enemies could do with that knowledge. This is why they've spent millennia erasing records of themselves. |
| **Where Resolved** | 06-four-page-synopsis.md (Part 1), Scene 4-5 |

## Q020 - What Is the Creation War?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | NotW (Skarpi), WMF (Felurian, Adem) |
| **The Mystery** | Ancient war between Namers/Knowers and Shapers. What really happened? Who won? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Shapers created the Fae realm; 2) Iax stole the moon; 3) Lanre was a hero who turned; 4) The Chandrian are the survivors; 5) It ended with the Doors being sealed |
| **Our Resolution** | The Creation War was fought between those who accepted the world as it was (Knowers/Namers) and those who believed they could improve it (Shapers). Iax was the greatest Shaper—he created the Fae realm and, desiring more, stole the moon, binding it between worlds. This violation of natural order triggered the war. Lanre was a hero who discovered something terrible about the war's true nature (possibly that both sides were wrong, or that something worse was coming) and destroyed the cities to prevent worse catastrophe. The war ended when Iax was imprisoned behind the Doors of Stone. The Chandrian are Lanre and his followers, cursed by their actions. |

## Q021 - Who Is Iax/Jax?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | WMF (Hespe's story, Felurian) |
| **The Mystery** | The boy who stole the moon. Greatest of the Shapers. Possibly still alive/imprisoned. |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Imprisoned behind the Doors; 2) The Cthaeh is Iax; 3) He'll be released; 4) He's "Jax" from the children's story; 5) He became something inhuman |
| **Our Resolution** | Iax was the greatest Shaper, whose hubris in stealing the moon triggered the Creation War. He was defeated but could not be killed in any conventional sense—Shapers at that level transcend normal death. His body was destroyed but his power/consciousness was imprisoned behind the Doors of Stone. What Kvothe releases is not Iax as a person but the remnant of his power—a force of shaping and chaos that breaks the boundary between worlds. |
| **Where Resolved** | 06-four-page-synopsis.md (Part 4), Scene 73 |

## Q022 - What Is the Moon's Significance?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | WMF (Felurian, Hespe's story) |
| **The Mystery** | The moon moves between the mortal world and Fae. Iax stole part of it. What's the connection? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) The moon's name is split between worlds; 2) Full moon = mortal, no moon = Fae; 3) The Lackless rhyme references the moon; 4) Restoring the moon ends the Chandrian curse |
| **Our Resolution** | Iax stole the moon's name (not the moon itself), binding it partially to the Fae realm he created. This is why the moon moves between worlds—its name is divided. The "night with no moon" is when the passage between worlds is easiest. The Doors of Stone were sealed during such a night. Opening them requires the same conditions. The moon's division is a wound in reality that has never healed. |
| **Where Resolved** | 06-four-page-synopsis.md (Part 3), Scene 60 |

## Q023 - What Is the Significance of Three Days?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF Frame Structure |
| **The Mystery** | The frame story takes three days. "My name is Kvothe. I have three days. This is day one." Why three? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Mirrors fairy tale structure; 2) Three days until something arrives; 3) Related to the silence of three parts; 4) A spell requiring three days; 5) Kvothe is dying and has three days left |
| **Our Resolution** | Three is significant throughout the story: three days to tell the tale, three locks on the chest, three silences. The three days are enough time to tell a complete story—enough for Chronicler to record the truth before whatever is coming arrives. The scrael attack on the third night is not coincidence; the telling of the story has drawn attention. Whether Kvothe planned this or not is ambiguous. |
| **Where Resolved** | Frame structure throughout, Scene 93-97 |

## Q024 - What Are the Scrael?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | NotW (opening), WMF Frame |
| **The Mystery** | Spider-like creatures appearing in the mortal world. Fae creatures? Why are they appearing? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Fae creatures escaping; 2) Heralds of something worse; 3) Connected to what Kvothe released; 4) Hunting Kvothe specifically |
| **Our Resolution** | Scrael are Fae creatures that shouldn't be in the mortal world—their presence indicates the barrier between worlds is weakening. They're the vanguard of what Kvothe released: when the Doors opened, the boundary began to collapse. Scrael are dangerous but minor compared to what follows. Their increasing numbers throughout the frame story show the situation worsening. |
| **Where Resolved** | Frame throughout, Scene 93-95 |

## Q025 - Will Kvothe Return to Being Kvothe?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟠 IMPORTANT |
| **Source** | Frame story |
| **The Mystery** | The central question of the frame: will Kvothe reclaim himself? Should he? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) He'll have no choice when danger comes; 2) He's waiting for the right moment; 3) He'll choose to stay Kote; 4) He'll partially return; 5) He can't return—it's irreversible |
| **Our Resolution** | **Ambiguous by design.** The novel ends with Kvothe reaching for the chest as the scrael attack. We don't see if he opens it. The silence of three parts remains—but one silence may be changing. The choice is presented, not resolved. This preserves the tragic structure while offering hope. It's up to the reader to decide whether Kvothe's return would be salvation or catastrophe. |

# 🟡 MODERATE MYSTERIES (Should Address)

## Q026 - What Happened to Denna After?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | WMF, Frame story absence |
| **The Mystery** | Denna is absent from the frame story. Where is she? What happened between her and Kvothe? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) She died; 2) She left after learning the truth about her patron; 3) She's still alive somewhere; 4) She and Kvothe parted forever; 5) She's waiting for him |
| **Our Resolution** | After the catastrophe at the Doors, Denna finally understood what her patron was. Her songs, woven with yllish magic, had helped prepare the world for the Chandrian's narrative. She wanders now—no patron, no home—living with the consequences of choices she didn't fully understand. She cannot go to Kvothe because she doesn't know what to say. Their love story ended in silence, not resolution. |

## Q027 - Will Ambrose Jakis Become King?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF (Ambrose's succession position) |
| **The Mystery** | Ambrose is repeatedly noted as being high in line for succession. Will he become king? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Kvothe kills Ambrose after he becomes king; 2) Ambrose's family schemes succeed; 3) The succession crisis involves him; 4) He becomes a minor king somewhere |
| **Our Resolution** | Ambrose does not become king in our telling. The king Kvothe kills is Roderic Calanthis. However, the war and succession crisis that follow benefit the Jakis family, and Ambrose's rising power is part of the chaos engulfing the Four Corners. He remains a personal enemy but not THE enemy. |
| **Where Resolved** | 07-character-charts.md (implied), Scene 77 clarifies which king |

## Q028 - What Is Elodin's History?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF (Elodin's past, cracked) |
| **The Mystery** | Elodin was committed to Haven (the asylum). He broke out. What happened to him? Why did he crack? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) He learned his own true name; 2) He learned something too big for a human mind; 3) He tried what Kvothe eventually does; 4) He saw behind the Doors |
| **Our Resolution** | Elodin walked the same path Kvothe walks—brilliant, impatient, seeking forbidden knowledge. He pushed too far into Naming, glimpsing truths the human mind struggles to contain. He cracked, spent years in Haven, and emerged... different. He survived by luck, not wisdom. He sees his younger self in Kvothe and tries to slow him down, but knows he cannot stop someone determined to destroy themselves. His warnings to Kvothe carry the weight of personal experience. |

## Q029 - What Is Devi's Full Story?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | WMF (money-lender, expelled arcanist) |
| **The Mystery** | Devi was expelled from the University. She's extremely powerful. She holds Kvothe's blood. What's her story? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Expelled for forbidden research; 2) She's an Amyr agent; 3) She'll betray Kvothe; 4) She was too powerful and scared them; 5) She sought the four-plate door |
| **Our Resolution** | Devi was expelled for pursuing knowledge the Masters deemed too dangerous—possibly related to the Amyr or the four-plate door. She became a money-lender to maintain access to arcanist networks and continue her research independently. She helps Kvothe investigate but draws the line at the Doors of Stone—even she knows some things shouldn't be opened. Her blood-holding is leverage, not threat; she never uses it against him. |
| **Where Resolved** | Scenes 17, 32-33, 47 |

## Q030 - What Is the Singers' Role?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | NotW (troupe murder—Chandrian fear "someone who sings") |
| **The Mystery** | The Chandrian seemed to fear something called "the singers." Who are they? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) The Sithe; 2) The Amyr; 3) A third faction; 4) Tahl (singing tree people); 5) Those who know true names (singing = Naming) |
| **Our Resolution** | The "singers" refer to those who know the Chandrian's true names—Namers who could call and bind them. The Chandrian fled from Kvothe's parents because they sensed approach of those who might know such names. The Sithe are part of this, as are certain Amyr. "Singing" is an old term for speaking names of power. |
| **Where Resolved** | Referenced in Scene 19 (Auri), thematic in Part 1 |

## Q031 - What Is Master Lorren's Secret?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF (Archives, missing books) |
| **The Mystery** | Lorren seems to be hiding something. Books about the Amyr keep disappearing. Is he an Amyr? |
| **Fan Theories** | Nearly universal belief he's an Amyr or connected to them |
| **Our Resolution** | **Confirmed.** Lorren is a member of the hidden Amyr. He has spent his career protecting dangerous knowledge—not by destroying it but by restricting access. The books aren't missing; they're in the four-plate door vault. His placid demeanor hides someone who has made terrible choices "for the greater good." He confronts Kvothe as a threat and ultimately pursues him when Kvothe won't be controlled. |
| **Where Resolved** | 04-one-page-synopsis.md, Scenes 11-14, 56-57 |

## Q032 - What Is the Waystone Inn's Significance?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF (name, location) |
| **The Mystery** | Why that name? Why that location? What are waystones? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Waystones are Fae gates; 2) The location is strategically chosen; 3) The name is significant in old languages; 4) It's a waystation for travelers between worlds |
| **Our Resolution** | Waystones are ancient markers that indicate thin places between the mortal world and Fae. Kvothe chose this location deliberately—it's a crossroads, a place of power, a spot where the boundary is already weak. The name acknowledges what he knows about the place. Whether he's guarding something, waiting for something, or simply chose to die in a liminal space is ambiguous. |
| **Where Resolved** | Scene 88-89 (choosing the location) |

## Q033 - What Is Puppet's Deal?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | WMF (Archives guardian, plays with puppets) |
| **The Mystery** | Puppet lives in the Archives, seems to know everything, guards the four-plate door. Who is he? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) An ancient Namer; 2) Cracked like Elodin; 3) Amyr guardian; 4) Connected to Taborlin; 5) He IS the four-plate door's guardian |
| **Our Resolution** | Puppet is one of the Amyr's guardians—not a leader but a warden. His mind works differently (cracked, enlightened, or simply strange), allowing him to perceive threats to the Archives. His puppets are more than toys; they're sympathetic links he uses to monitor. He recognizes Kvothe as Lackless blood and warns the other Amyr. |
| **Where Resolved** | Scene 10 (four-plate door scene) |

## Q034 - What Is the Stone Kvothe Uses as Alar Training?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | NotW (the stone he imagines as home for his belief) |
| **The Mystery** | Kvothe uses visualization of a stone to strengthen his Alar. Is it just a technique, or more? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Just a mental technique; 2) The Heart of Stone is related to the Doors of Stone; 3) Foreshadowing his eventual stone-speaking |
| **Our Resolution** | The technique is legitimate but foreshadows Kvothe's eventual connection to the name of stone. His ability to visualize and believe so firmly is what allows him to eventually speak the name and open the Doors. The stone imagery recurs throughout. |
| **Where Resolved** | Thematic connection in Scenes 63-64, 72 |

---

## Q035 - Why Does Kvothe's Troupe Die So Near the University?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | NotW (geography implies proximity) |
| **The Mystery** | The troupe was killed relatively close to the University. Coincidence? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Arliden was heading there; 2) The University has Chandrian-related artifacts; 3) Pure coincidence; 4) The Amyr presence drew them |
| **Our Resolution** | Not coincidence. Arliden was traveling toward the University to continue his Chandrian research—he'd heard there were records there. The Chandrian caught him before he could arrive. The proximity is significant because it put young Kvothe within eventual reach of both the University's knowledge and the Amyr's attention. |
| **Where Resolved** | Implied in Scene 4-5 (research connection) |

---

## Q036 - What Is the Lethani?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | WMF (Adem philosophy) |
| **The Mystery** | The Adem's guiding philosophy. What exactly is it? How does it relate to the larger story? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) A form of enlightenment; 2) Connected to Naming; 3) The "right action" philosophy; 4) Preparation for fighting Chandrian |
| **Our Resolution** | The Lethani is the Adem's understanding of right action—knowing what to do in any situation through intuition rather than rules. It's related to Naming in that both require perceiving the true nature of things. Kvothe's training in the Lethani prepares him to make instinctive decisions, which both helps and hurts him—he acts without fully thinking, which is how the Cthaeh's manipulation works. |
| **Where Resolved** | Thematic throughout, especially Scene 69-72 (battle) |

---

## Q037 - What Is the Sword Caesura's Significance?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | WMF (Adem sword, name meaning) |
| **The Mystery** | Kvothe's sword is named Caesura, meaning "a break in a line of verse." Why this name? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) It breaks verse (kills poets/songs); 2) It breaks the line of kings; 3) Foreshadows the break in Kvothe's story; 4) Named after or by Kvothe's mother |
| **Our Resolution** | The name is prophetic: Caesura is the break in the story, the pause in the verse that is Kvothe's life. It's the weapon that killed the king—breaking the line of succession. In the chest, it represents the break between who Kvothe was and who he is now. The sword that made him Kingkiller waits to make him Kvothe again. |
| **Where Resolved** | Scene 77 (king's death), Scene 90 (chest) |

## Q038 - What Are the Seven Words to Make a Woman Love You?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | NotW (Kvothe mentions knowing them) |
| **The Mystery** | Kvothe claims to know seven words that will make a woman love him. What are they? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) It's a joke; 2) They're someone's true name; 3) "I will not seek to possess you"; 4) Related to Denna; 5) He never actually learned them |
| **Our Resolution** | **Deliberately never revealed.** This is Kvothe's storytelling bravado—he mentions it early to hook listeners, but it's misdirection. The closest we get is understanding that Kvothe's failure with Denna came from saying the WRONG words, not knowing the right ones. True love can't be commanded. The seven words he needed were probably closer to "I trust you to save yourself." |
| **Where Resolved** | Thematic anti-resolution in Scenes 36-40 |

---

## Q039 - What Is Taborlin the Great's Connection?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF (stories throughout) |
| **The Mystery** | The legendary hero Taborlin. Was he real? Is Kvothe following his path? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Kvothe is becoming Taborlin; 2) Taborlin was an arcanist; 3) The Taborlin stories are Kvothe's future; 4) Taborlin fought the Chandrian |
| **Our Resolution** | Taborlin was real—a powerful Namer who lived after the Creation War and fought against dark forces. The stories have grown in the telling, but the core is true. Kvothe's journey parallels Taborlin's intentionally: Rothfuss uses this to show how legends form from flawed reality. Kvothe becomes a Taborlin-like figure in legend while being something much more complicated in truth. |
| **Where Resolved** | Thematic parallel throughout |

## Q040 - Why Did Lanre Become Haliax?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟡 MODERATE |
| **Source** | NotW (Skarpi's story), WMF (Denna's song) |
| **The Mystery** | Lanre was a hero. He destroyed Myr Tariniel and became Haliax. What turned him? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Lyra's death broke him; 2) He learned something terrible; 3) The Cthaeh poisoned him; 4) He was trying to prevent something worse; 5) The enemy corrupted him |
| **Our Resolution** | Lanre was broken by Lyra's death, but that alone didn't turn him. He sought to bring her back and, in doing so, discovered truths about the Creation War that made him believe the cities had to fall. Whether he was right (preventing worse catastrophe) or wrong (manipulated by Cthaeh/Iax) is ambiguous. Denna's song presents his version. Skarpi's story presents the survivors' version. The truth is somewhere between. He became Haliax—"the breath of Iax"—suggesting some merger with Iax's power or purpose. |
| **Where Resolved** | Thematic in Part 2 (Denna's song), Scene 73 |

# 🟢 MINOR MYSTERIES (Nice to Address)

## Q041 - What Is the Story of Princess Ariel?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟢 MINOR |
| **Source** | NotW (bar stories mention Kvothe and Princess Ariel) |
| **The Mystery** | Kvothe supposedly has a story involving a Princess Ariel. Is this Auri? Someone else? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Auri's full name is Ariel; 2) A separate adventure; 3) Misremembered legend; 4) Future event |
| **Our Resolution** | Left ambiguous. "Princess Ariel" may be Auri (and the story grew in the telling), may be a separate adventure, or may be a legend that attached to Kvothe incorrectly. Not every legend about Kvothe is true—this is part of the theme about how stories distort. |
| **Where Resolved** | Not directly resolved; thematic |

## Q042 - What Is Folly?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟢 MINOR |
| **Source** | NotW (sword above the bar) |
| **The Mystery** | The sword mounted in the Waystone Inn is called "Folly." Is it Caesura? Another sword? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) It IS Caesura, renamed; 2) A different sword; 3) The name reflects Kvothe's self-assessment; 4) A Chandrian sword |
| **Our Resolution** | Folly is likely Caesura, renamed to reflect Kvothe's view of his past actions. "The sword that made me the Kingkiller" becomes "Folly." The mounting is public—a confession visible to anyone who understands. Or it may be a different sword entirely (taken from Cinder?). This mystery is left slightly ambiguous. |
| **Where Resolved** | Implied Scene 90 |

---

## Q043 - What Is Kvothe's Real Third Name?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟢 MINOR |
| **Source** | WMF (Adem names, Maedre meaning) |
| **The Mystery** | The Adem gave Kvothe the name Maedre, which has three meanings. His mother called him something special. |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Connections to his true name; 2) Each meaning is prophetic; 3) His mother's pet name was significant |
| **Our Resolution** | Maedre's three meanings (flame, thunder, broken tree) are prophetic: he brings fire and destruction (flame), his reputation thunders across the world (thunder), and he becomes a broken thing himself (broken tree). His mother's name for him—whatever it was—tied to her Lackless heritage. These names all circle aspects of his true name. |
| **Where Resolved** | Thematic throughout |

---

## Q044 - What Happened to the Other Troupers' Bodies?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟢 MINOR |
| **Source** | NotW (troupe massacre) |
| **The Mystery** | Kvothe buries his parents, but what about the others? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) He buried everyone; 2) Only his parents' bodies remained; 3) Some escaped; 4) Ben found them |
| **Our Resolution** | Not addressed in detail. Kvothe was traumatized and focused on his parents. The implication is that he buried what he could before fleeing into the woods to survive. The full extent of the massacre and his response is too painful for him to detail. |
| **Where Resolved** | Not directly resolved |

---

## Q045 - What Is Ben Doing Now?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟢 MINOR |
| **Source** | NotW (left the troupe before the massacre) |
| **The Mystery** | Ben (Abenthy), Kvothe's first teacher, left the troupe. Where is he? Does he know what happened? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) He'll reappear; 2) He's dead; 3) He's searching for Kvothe; 4) He's at the University under another name |
| **Our Resolution** | Ben settled in a town with his new wife and heard rumors of the troupe's fate. He grieved but never found Kvothe. He may hear the legends of the Kingkiller and wonder, but they never reconnect. This is one of many "what-ifs" in Kvothe's life—mentors lost, paths not taken. |
| **Where Resolved** | Not directly resolved |

## Q046 - What Is the Significance of Copper?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟢 MINOR |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF (copper knife against Cinder, copper box, Haven's copper walls) |
| **The Mystery** | Copper seems resistant to magic. Why? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Copper grounds magic; 2) It's why Haven has copper walls; 3) Namers can't perceive copper; 4) Ancient shaping property |
| **Our Resolution** | Copper is resistant to Naming—it has no name that can be called, or its name is too simple to grasp. This makes it effective for containing or protecting against magical threats. Kvothe's copper knife against Cinder, Haven's copper walls for cracked Namers—both exploit this property. It's not explained, just demonstrated. |
| **Where Resolved** | Implied throughout |

## Q047 - What Do Kvothe's Dreams Mean?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟢 MINOR |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF (recurring dream imagery) |
| **The Mystery** | Kvothe has significant dreams—are they prophetic? Psychological? Magical? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) Connected to Naming; 2) Influenced by Cthaeh; 3) Messages from the sleeping mind; 4) Fae interference |
| **Our Resolution** | Dreams in this world have power—they're connected to the sleeping mind where names are known without being learned. Kvothe's dreams are his subconscious processing truths his waking mind won't accept. They're not prophetic but revelatory. The "thing that comes with sleeping" in the Lackless rhyme refers to this dream-knowledge. |
| **Where Resolved** | Scene 60-61 (rhyme interpretation) |

---

## Q048 - What Are the Swords in the Eld?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟢 MINOR |
| **Source** | WMF (bandit camp finds) |
| **The Mystery** | The bandit camp had supplies suggesting organized backing. Who funded them? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) The Jakis family; 2) Cinder's own resources; 3) Rival kingdom; 4) Amyr operation |
| **Our Resolution** | The bandits were funded by interests aligned with the Chandrian—destabilizing the Maer's territory served their purposes. The specifics are less important than the pattern: chaos serving someone's design. |
| **Where Resolved** | Not directly resolved |

## Q049 - What Is the Rhinna Flower?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟢 MINOR |
| **Source** | WMF (Cthaeh's tree has the panacea flowers) |
| **The Mystery** | The Cthaeh's tree grows the only medicine that can cure anything. Why? Connection? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) The tree and the cure are bait; 2) The Cthaeh was a healer corrupted; 3) Balance—poison and cure together; 4) Fae ecology |
| **Our Resolution** | The Rhinna flowers are genuine—they can cure any illness. But they grow on the Cthaeh's tree, meaning anyone who seeks them must speak with the oracle. The cure comes with a cost: the Cthaeh's words will poison your future even as the flower heals your present. This is why the Sithe guard both—the cure cannot be safely obtained. |
| **Where Resolved** | Referenced in Scene 82-83 (Cthaeh reflection) |

---

## Q050 - What Is Bredon's Role?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | 🟢 MINOR |
| **Source** | WMF (mysterious nobleman) |
| **The Mystery** | Bredon befriends Kvothe, teaches him tak, disappears when Denna's patron appears. Is he Master Ash? |
| **Fan Theories** | 1) He IS Master Ash; 2) He's Amyr; 3) He's Chandrian; 4) Red herring—just a friendly nobleman; 5) He's Caudicus's employer |
| **Our Resolution** | **Red herring.** Bredon is exactly what he appears to be: a bored, intelligent nobleman who enjoys games and took interest in an interesting young man. His disappearances coincide with Denna's patron for dramatic effect, not causation. Not every mystery requires a sinister answer. |
| **Where Resolved** | Not a plot point; thematic misdirection |

# ⚪ AMBIENT MYSTERIES (Better Left Mysterious)

## Q051 - What Is the Nature of the Fae Realm?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | ⚪ AMBIENT |
| **Source** | WMF (Felurian section) |
| **The Mystery** | The Fae was shaped by the Shapers. How does it work? What are its rules? |
| **Our Resolution** | The Fae remains largely mysterious. It operates on different rules—time flows differently, physical laws are suggestions, intention matters more than action. Kvothe passes through it but doesn't understand it fully. Neither should the reader. The wonder lies in the not-knowing. |
| **Where Resolved** | Ambient worldbuilding |

## Q052 - What Is the Full History of the Creation War?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | ⚪ AMBIENT |
| **Source** | Various legends |
| **The Mystery** | The complete history of the war between Namers and Shapers. |
| **Our Resolution** | We get pieces: Iax stealing the moon, Lanre's betrayal, the fall of the cities, the sealing of the Doors. But the full history remains fragmentary—as it would be after thousands of years. Perfect knowledge would undermine the mythic quality. |
| **Where Resolved** | Fragments throughout |

## Q053 - What Are the Sithe?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | ⚪ AMBIENT |
| **Source** | WMF (guard the Cthaeh) |
| **The Mystery** | The Sithe guard the Cthaeh and hunt those who speak to it. Who are they? |
| **Our Resolution** | The Sithe are Fae warriors dedicated to containing the Cthaeh's influence. They're ancient, implacable, and utterly focused. They failed to kill Kvothe after he spoke to the Cthaeh—one of the greatest strokes of luck (or manipulation) in his life. Their full nature remains mysterious. |
| **Where Resolved** | Referenced but not explained |

## Q054 - What Is the Moon's Full Name?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | ⚪ AMBIENT |
| **Source** | WMF (Felurian) |
| **The Mystery** | Felurian knows the moon's name but won't speak it. Iax stole part of it. What is it? |
| **Our Resolution** | **Not revealed.** Some names are too powerful to be spoken aloud, even in a story. The moon's name remains one of the world's deepest secrets. |
| **Where Resolved** | Deliberately unresolved |

---

## Q055 - What Are the Rules of Naming?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | ⚪ AMBIENT |
| **Source** | Throughout |
| **The Mystery** | How exactly does Naming work? What are its limits? |
| **Our Resolution** | Naming remains somewhat mystical by design. It's not a system to be mastered like sympathy—it's an art, an insight, a way of perceiving. Explaining it fully would reduce its wonder. Elodin's teaching methods exist because Naming can't be taught systematically. |
| **Where Resolved** | Thematic choice |

---

## Q056 - What Happens After Death?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | ⚪ AMBIENT |
| **Source** | NotW (Denna's question to Kvothe) |
| **The Mystery** | Is there an afterlife in this world? Where do souls go? |
| **Our Resolution** | **Not answered.** Kvothe doesn't know. The world doesn't have a confirmed metaphysics of death. Tehlu and the angels might be real or might be stories. The uncertainty is part of the human condition being explored. |
| **Where Resolved** | Deliberately unresolved |

---

## Q057 - How Does Sympathy Really Work?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | ⚪ AMBIENT |
| **Source** | NotW/WMF (magic system) |
| **The Mystery** | The scientific explanation of sympathy involves believing in links. But what's the deeper mechanism? |
| **Our Resolution** | Sympathy works because belief shapes reality in this world—the Alar is not just willpower but a way of imposing your understanding on the universe. The "laws" of sympathy are human attempts to systematize something more fundamental. Full explanation would undermine the magic. |
| **Where Resolved** | Ambient; not fully explained by design |

---

## Q058 - What Is Tehlu's True Nature?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | ⚪ AMBIENT |
| **Source** | NotW (Trapis's story), WMF (Skarpi's version) |
| **The Mystery** | Is Tehlu a god? An angel? A Ruach? Aleph's creation? |
| **Our Resolution** | Different stories present different Tehlus. The Tehlan Church's version is devotional. Skarpi's version suggests Tehlu was once human/Ruach, transformed by Aleph into something more. The truth is less important than the function: Tehlu represents divine intervention against demons (Chandrian). Whether that intervention is real or legendary affects the world regardless. |
| **Where Resolved** | Multiple versions presented; reader chooses |

## Q059 - What Became of the Other Ruach/Angels?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | ⚪ AMBIENT |
| **Source** | NotW (Skarpi's story mentions multiple angels) |
| **The Mystery** | Aleph made multiple angels. What happened to them? Are they still active? |
| **Our Resolution** | They appear at the edges of the story, if at all. The angels (or what became of them) may be behind some of the world's protections, may have faded, may still intervene in subtle ways. They remain legendary. |
| **Where Resolved** | Ambient mythology |

## Q060 - What Is the Complete Chandrian Rhyme?
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Status** | ⚪ AMBIENT |
| **Source** | WMF (Adem version partial) |
| **The Mystery** | We have fragments of rhymes about the Chandrian. What's the complete version? |
| **Our Resolution** | The Adem rhyme gives names and signs. Other versions exist. But no complete, authoritative text survives—that's part of the Chandrian's campaign to erase themselves. The fragmentation is the point. |
| **Where Resolved** | Fragments provided; completeness impossible |
