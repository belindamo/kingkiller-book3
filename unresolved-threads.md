# Unresolved Plot Threads in The Kingkiller Chronicle

*A comprehensive analysis of mysteries that must be addressed in Book 3*

## 🔥 THE MAJOR MYSTERIES

### 1. The Chandrian
**What We Know:**
- Seven beings led by Haliax (formerly Lanre, a tragic hero who destroyed Myr Tariniel)
- Each has a distinctive "sign" (Cinder's black eyes, Haliax's shadow, etc.)
- They killed Kvothe's troupe because his father Arliden was researching their true names
- The Adem know them as "Rhinta" and have a rhyme with their names and signs
- They seem to fear someone/something—they fled when Kvothe's parents died

**What We Don't Know:**
- Their ultimate goal beyond hiding their existence
- Why Lanre/Haliax turned against the cities he protected
- What enemies do they fear? (The Amyr? The Sithe? The Singers?)
- Where do they reside between appearances?
- Can they be killed, and if so, how?

**Resolution in Book 3:** Kvothe discovers the Chandrian's origin connects to the Creation War. Their curse binds them to existence—they cannot die and seek to either break free or destroy all memory of their original sin. Kvothe must confront Cinder directly.

### 2. Denna's Patron ("Master Ash")
**What We Know:**
- A mysterious man who sponsors Denna's musical education
- Beats her (the Cthaeh confirms this)
- Taught her a song that portrays Lanre as a hero (directly contradicting Kvothe's knowledge)
- Denna uses many aliases, possibly at his direction
- He seems to be researching the same history Kvothe seeks

**Possible Identities:**
- **Cinder** (signs point here—Ash/Cinder wordplay, presence at Mauthen farm)
- **Bredon** (mysterious nobleman who disappears when Denna's patron appears)
- **An Amyr operative**
- **Lorren** (unlikely but fits some patterns)

**Resolution in Book 3:** Denna's patron is revealed to be Cinder, manipulating her to spread a narrative that portrays the Chandrian sympathetically. This revelation destroys Kvothe and Denna's relationship when she realizes the truth—and when Kvothe is forced to choose between her and vengeance.

---

### 3. Kvothe's "Fall" and Current State
**What We Know (Frame Story):**
- Kvothe is known as "Kingkiller"—he killed a king
- He runs a rural inn under the name "Kote" (possibly meaning "disaster" in Siaru)
- He seems unable to perform magic or fight effectively
- He appears to be waiting to die
- There's a war raging, and he seems to have caused it
- The scrael (dangerous Fae creatures) are appearing in the mortal world
- His chest contains something significant he cannot open

**What We Don't Know:**
- Which king did he kill, and why?
- What happened to his hands/abilities?
- Where is Denna?
- What's in the thrice-locked chest?
- Why did he truly go into hiding?
- What is Bast's real agenda?

**Resolution in Book 3:** Kvothe killed King Roderic Calanthis to prevent a greater catastrophe but was manipulated by the Chandrian into doing so. His attempt to speak the Name of something forbidden (perhaps his own true name, or the name of the moon) locked away his power. The chest contains his true name, his lute, and evidence of what really happened.

### 4. The Amyr
**What We Know:**
- An ancient order dedicated to "the greater good"
- The original Amyr were non-human, serving the empire before the Church created a human version
- Supposedly disbanded by the Church centuries ago
- Records of them are mysteriously disappearing from the Archives
- Their symbol is a bloody hand
- Lorren may be secretly one of them (or protecting them)

**What We Don't Know:**
- Do they still exist?
- Are they allied against the Chandrian or something else?
- What is their relationship to the Ciridae (judges who could kill without consequence)?
- Why are they erasing their own history?

**Resolution in Book 3:** The Amyr never disbanded—they went underground. Lorren is revealed as a member. Their "greater good" involves containing something worse than the Chandrian, and Kvothe's meddling threatens to release it. The Amyr become antagonists who see Kvothe as a threat.

### 5. The Doors of Stone
**What We Know:**
- The title of Book 3
- The Lackless family guards "the door" to something ancient
- The Lackless rhyme hints at secrets: *"Seven things stand before / The entrance to the Lackless door"*
- Kvothe's mother was likely Netalia Lackless (making him heir to the Lackless)
- The four-plate door in the Archives contains something significant
- The Cthaeh mentioned "the Doors of Stone"

**What We Don't Know:**
- What lies behind the door(s)?
- Is there one door or multiple?
- Connection to the Creation War and the Chandrian?
- Is this where the moon was locked away?

**Resolution in Book 3:** The Lackless door guards the prison of something from the Creation War—possibly Iax/Jax himself, who stole the moon. Kvothe's heritage gives him access. Opening the door is what causes the current catastrophe in the frame story.

---

### 6. The Cthaeh's Prophecies
**What We Know:**
- The Cthaeh is perfectly malicious and omniscient
- Everything it says is designed to cause maximum harm
- It told Kvothe: "The Maer's family is close to the Amyr" and about Denna's abuse
- Bast was horrified that Kvothe spoke to it
- The Sithe guard it to prevent anyone from leaving after speaking to it

**Key Prophecies to Fulfill:**
- "Cyphus bears the blue flame" (identifies a Chandrian)
- Hints about the Maer and Amyr connection
- The implication that Kvothe's actions will cause catastrophe

**Resolution in Book 3:** Every choice Kvothe makes plays into the Cthaeh's design. His quest for vengeance, his love for Denna, his curiosity about the Lackless door—all were nudged toward disaster. The tragedy is that knowing this changes nothing.

---

### 7. Kvothe's True Name / Naming Magic
**What We Know:**
- Kvothe has called the wind several times
- He briefly called the Name of Fire
- Elodin is teaching him Naming
- There are hints that calling one's own true name is significant (and dangerous)
- "Kote" may mean "disaster" or be a deliberate diminishing of his Name

**What We Don't Know:**
- Can someone change their own true name?
- Did Kvothe "lock away" part of himself?
- What is Kvothe's full true name?

**Resolution in Book 3:** Kvothe attempted to speak his own name to change himself—to become someone who could do what needed to be done. But names are not fully controllable. He locked away his power and became "Kote"—a broken echo of himself. The chest contains his true name, written down, which he cannot speak aloud.

## 🌙 SECONDARY MYSTERIES

### 8. The Moon and the Fae
- Iax/Jax stole the moon, which moves between mortal world and Fae
- The Creation War may have been fought over this
- Felurian knows ancient secrets but wouldn't tell Kvothe everything
- The Faen realm is connected to the Chandrian's curse

### 9. Princess Ariel
- A story exists about Kvothe and "Princess Ariel"
- Possibly Auri? Her full name is unknown
- She knows the Underthing intimately and may be royalty

### 10. The Lackless Box
- The Maer showed Kvothe a box with no obvious opening
- Kvothe felt drawn to it
- Connected to the Lackless rhymes and secrets

### 11. Bast's True Agenda
- He arranged for Chronicler to find Kvothe
- He tried to arrange an attack to "wake up" Kvothe
- He's desperate to restore his teacher
- Is he serving Kvothe—or using him?

### 12. Ambrose Jakis
- High in line for the throne
- Kvothe's persistent enemy
- "He killed a king"—did Kvothe kill Ambrose after he became king?

### 13. Devi
- Powerful expelled arcanist
- Holds Kvothe's blood
- What is her full story and role?

### 14. Auri
- Lives in the Underthing
- Clearly had a traumatic past
- Possibly noble, possibly cracked after learning something terrible
- Her full name and history remain unknown

## 📖 HOW BOOK 3 RESOLVES THESE

The Doors of Stone must weave these threads into a single tapestry:

1. **Kvothe's search for the Chandrian** leads him to the Lackless door
2. **Denna's patron** is revealed as Cinder, shattering their relationship
3. **The Amyr** emerge as morally ambiguous—not clear heroes
4. **The Cthaeh's manipulation** becomes clear only in retrospect
5. **Kvothe kills a king** (likely Ambrose, possibly Roderic) but is manipulated into it
6. **Opening the door** releases something that causes the current war
7. **Kvothe's naming of himself** is his attempt to undo the damage—and his undoing
8. **The frame story** concludes with Kvothe finally reclaiming himself—or accepting his fate

## 🎭 THE TRAGEDY

The Kingkiller Chronicle is explicitly a tragedy. Kvothe tells us at the start:

> "I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep."

And yet he ends up a broken innkeeper, waiting to die.

The tragedy is that Kvothe's brilliance, his relentless pursuit of knowledge and vengeance, his inability to let things go—these are what destroy him. The Cthaeh's true cruelty is that it told Kvothe the truth. Every step he takes toward his goals brings him closer to ruin.

**The Question for Book 3:** Is there redemption? Or only the completion of the fall?

*"There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man."*
